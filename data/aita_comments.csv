1ods0of,nkw8l4k,apprehensive814,"NTA. Your wife's family is being toxic and because she grew up being constantly bullied, she normalizes and rationalizes it because facing the truth is difficult. Maybe her family loves her but this is not how people show love. Sending a text about it wasn't helpful only because your wife's family have never had to consider their behavior as an issue. So they spun it back on you and made you the problem, just like I'm sure they have done to wife whenever she has pushed back.   Your wife needs therapy to reflect on how her family has treated her and the mental toll it takes on her. She needs to learn how to put up boundaries for her own sake. Couples therapy would also be beneficial.   I say this from a place of a similar background as your wife. I grew up with cousins who bullied me relentlessly and whenever I pushed back I was called sensitive or dramatic. They could pull mean pranks, call me stupid, make fun of my health issues, call me any name they could think of. The instant I said anything back, or asked them to stop, or reacted in anyway in anger or sadness I was suddenly the problem. They broke my confidence in myself and it took years to deal with the mental damage they did. Therapy helped me see that their behavior was a reflection on them and was something I did not deserve. Boundaries helped me see that their behavior was toxic because they reacted so badly. I am low contact with them and it has helped tremendously.  Your wife needs to come to the realization that her family is mistreating her.

I don't see how this is your fault.  They can't argue that you're responsible for her phone breaking when 3 people were involved.

(Value being the cost of the phone to buy new (if she got it new), divide the total by half (if the phone is more than a year old), then divided by the number of years that the phone is usable (less one). For example about 5 years, less 1; 4 years.  Example. Say the phone cost was $1000 3 years ago.   50% of that value is lost nearly right away. 1000÷2= $500.   Phone can easily last 5 years, 3 years used, so it has 2 years left on its life that need to be compensated for.   So $500 divided by 4 is $125. 2 years used is $250.  Leaving $250 ($125 for each of the years of usable life left).  But you were one of 3 people participating in the behaviour. So that $250 is not all on you, it's 1/3 your problem. Which brings the total to $83.34.   So at most, you would be responsible for $83.34 (as an example).  Or if it's fixable, you're responsible for 1/3 of the repair cost.

She could easily stop bringing things back for you as she clearly has an expectation for you to do some kind things like she does as your friend. You never asked for any of what she’s done so she doesn’t really have the right to expect anything. Although looking at it from an outside, less logical perspective, given the fact that she does perform these kind acts for you (assuming that at first she wasn’t looking for anything in return nor did she have any expectation of you to do the same), I do think you could try to reciprocate at least in the slight, not because she expects you to, but because it’s the kind and friendly thing to do, and by just doing kind things back out of the ideal of simply friendship, any negative or resentful feelings she has resulting from her expectations being too high would get better all together. So no, I don’t think you’re an asshole for her high expectations, but I do think you could be more thoughtful considering you call her your friend and even moreso the fact that you are now roommates. I’ve learned from my past that inviting friends as roommates can lead to a lot of resentment overtime, and it’s on both of you to work towards making sure that doesn’t happen (assuming you want to keep her as a friend and not just a past roommate). So maybe think about this the next time you go out and grab a coffee. It seems to me a pretty simple, noncostly thing you can do to ease any growing resentments.   If you went out of your way a lot of times to surprise your friend with food or gifts, sure your friend shouldn’t be expected to do the same, but wouldn’t it make both of you feel even more like friends and you feel loved back if your friend did something similar every now and then?

1odoy0g,nkzm8f8,Unhealthystudent-316,"Thank you all for your words, recommendations and pieces of advice.   I would like to touch on a few things, as I have seen them show up in the comments.  1. Why don't I just bring my own food/cook?  Well, this has definitely been the most reasonable option for me, and something I will try to do in the future. I, however, have tried doing this in the past, which caused conflict, as my boyfriend was questioned by his mother on ""why I think she can't cook"". In certain situation I have brought food to share with the rest of the family, and have gotten a cold shoulder from the mother. She has in the past expressed dislike for the gifts I give her (I always give small gifts every time I visit, like flowers, wine or other small things I think can be universally appreciated). I have just brushed it off as me not knowing her well enough to know all of her dislikes and likes.  The same thing has applied for the food I bring, where she has been cautious and tries one bite before dismissing it. I think I am a good cook and have been cooking with my mom my whole life, my boyfriend loves the food I make, and so it seems everyone else does. The MIL, however, seems to be neutral at best, mostly negative.  When I have asked, instead, to help her in the kitchen, she has seen this as a dig at her cooking abilities. I am instructed to handle the dishes instead, but am shooed away from the kitchen when it comes to cooking.  2) Why am I with my boyfriend?  I know that a lot of you have been critical of my boyfriend for not siding with me in this, but this is where it gets so difficult. We otherwise have a loving relationship, and he has never had an issue with my food preferences when it's just the two of us. The only problem, it seems like, is standing up to his own mother. I don't know if it is just their family dynamic, or if it is the culture in general, but I do not want to cause a rift between him and his family.  I love this person and have spent 3 years with him (with other difficulties, yes), but breaking up over this feels like such a big step and a bit extreme, especially considering it's mostly related to his mother and not him.  I see now that he is, in many ways, in the wrong, but I didn't even consider breaking up until I saw the comments. This had put thoughts in my head that I maybe should bring this up with him, I am just scared that he will side with his mother. We have had arguments in the past where we have disagreed on things. When I have expressed disagreements on certain questions, my boyfriend has said that I am indirectly criticizing his mother, as she has raised him to have certain beliefs.  My main concern and my biggest fear is that MIL will not respect my boundaries if we ever get children in the future.  3) Some other things for context  The MIL has previously expressed annoyance over the fact that I do not speak or understand their language and has told people that I should be able to speak the language after having spent so much time with her son. Her son, my boyfriend, has not spoken much of his native language to me, though. I know a few phrases here and there, but maybe I should have learnt more of their language as a sign of respect?  It might seem like his mother hates me, and honestly looking back, I don't know anymore. I thought that this tension might, at least partially, have to do with me. It seems like most people, though, think that I have not acted rudely or disrespectful toward her. I thought that she liked me, and just didn't know how to handle this specific issue, but this might be rooted in a deeper dissatisfaction. I am not sure.  So, I am in a pickle. I appreciate all of the advice, and I definitely need to think about how to handle the situation in the future, especially considering I am going to MIL in 2 weeks.

Her bedroom shares a wall, I’m sure she can’t help but hear a flush and then the water running. It’s not as if she has her ear to the wall. I live in a house and can hear the washing machine, showers, toilets, even the hoses in the yard from various rooms in the house. I’m not actively listening, it can just be heard.   It really stinks that the landlord won’t allow the bidet attachment for the toilet. Have you looked at alternatives like travel bidets? A friend was traveling from his country, where bidets are the norm to one where they weren’t, and found the travel bidet to work well. It hooked up to the sink and stretched to the toilet. You could attach and detach as needed. I would think that would be a lot more convenient than disrobing, getting in the shower, rinsing, drying, washing the shower, putting clothes back on…  An additional alternative could be an adult toilet wipe, like Dude Wipes or the Cottonelle brand. Mind you, most plumbers will state these should not be flushed, regardless of what is on the label. But this may be the perfect bridge between toilet paper and a bidet.",3,1761176779.0,3,0

Your father has manipulated your little brother, who is too young and dumb to know he is being manipulated. He doesn’t love the kid, if he did he wouldn’t do this. He just wants to win. Your mother is so upset that she has capitulated and is now playing your father’s game, which means a dimwit 13 year old is running both houses. This is bad news for everyone. Your mom should have held firm for the sake of you and your siblings. Your brother needs to understand that he is not the boss, because he’s clearly not capable of regulating himself. This is bigger than Christmas presents. I understand the urge not to reward him for bad behavior, but she’s too scared that he will see it as a rejection and she won’t do it.   Your mom’s rules aren’t wrong. Life is hard enough and exceptionally uncertain right now. Your mom is trying to instill self-motivation and determination into the rest of you, and to keep you from spending all your time on things like gaming, that can take over our lives and keep us from functioning. Self-regulating as a teenager can be really hard, which is why good parents set limits to help us do that. Having the self-discipline to do the hard stuff, the stuff that’s not so fun, the important stuff, is what will  give us the opportunities to have a better life in the long run. Giving in to every dopamine urge just makes that harder, and like all addiction it just gets worse over time. It makes it too easy to hide from life. Your brother is not on a good road, and in my opinion your mom isn’t handling it well because she’s letting her own emotions override what is better for your brother. Now that he knows he can manipulate her and that there are no rules, he will keep pushing boundaries until he completely crashes.    You can’t fix this. You can certainly tell your brother what you think of his behavior, but this is too big for you to solve. The best thing you can do is to realize that taking your brother’s path is a bad idea, and keep helping your younger siblings to the extent you can. I’m sorry your mom isn’t stepping up, but it’s not your fault.",1,1761177582.0,1,0

One of her suggestions based upon her studies, is that one successful way to modify eating behavior around foods we crave like cookies and chocolates, is to make them harder to access while making healthy foods we should eat more of more accessible.  She suggests putting cookies and chips up on the top shelf of a cupboard so that they are harder to reach; if you cut a piece from a pan of cake or brownies, she suggests immediately re-covering the pan, putting it away in the fridge or cupboard, and washing the serving utensil.         She doesn't mention putting a lock on the snack fridge in your bedroom, but it seems entirely consistent with her advice.  A second part of her advice that you could take might be to have washed veg. and healthy dip prepared in the fridge and leave a plate of them out on your desk when studying.

For crunchy and sweet, get carrot's and sprinkle them with Tajin (it's a Hispanic seasoning). If you want chips, you can buy some of the ones loaded with protein. Quest makes them. If you want a sandwich, get carb smart bread. This way you don't feel like you are missing out. Also, for malts and shakes....do a protein drink. Put yogurt in it instead of ice cream. You can put a chocolate protein powder, some Caco Chocolate chips (they don't have as many carbs and sugar in them, but give you the chocolate taste you are looking for).   I hope this helps.

You adopted a puppy and your kid didn’t have any reactions to them?  I’m just surprised that the kittens were the catalyst and not the puppy they lived with.

1od6b53,nkrr00f,readergirl35,"So first of all if he lives with you 6 out of 7 days a week he should not just be cooking and doing dishes occasionally. He should be sharing the house chores more. Also why is he not moved in and sharing the financials and chores? It's odd that he still maintains a home elsewhere and lives like a visitor in your home. I can see how that works for him. He pays rent or mortgage but barely anything to keep the utilities on.  he technically doesn't live with you so he has only the chores he wants to do, when he wants to and you are supposed to be grateful because he doesn't have to do them when it's not his home. He also gets to expect gratitude when he spends anything on groceries or gets something for your place because again he isn't obligated to do this in your home. So this arrangement keeps his financial burden lower than if he actually lived at his place. It keeps it lower than if he admitted he lives at your place. He has zero responsibility for chores or maintenance at yours and his place stays pretty pristine because he's so rarely there. Nice set up he has. How is it benefitting you though?    Now regards the question of should you have followed behind him cleaning. That was not great. You were being obsessive and that is difficult for everyone around.

Many years ago, I had an adorable Oriental, who lived the life of Riley (spoilt rotten, plenty of stimulation, etc) - and kept chewing her tail until it was raw. The vet suggested that she might be lonely. We got an older kitten (5-6 months or so) - and for a couple of months, they loathed each other, yikes - no toileting issues, just 'scrapping'.

In my personal life, people have told me that they find it calming and said that they miss my humming when I’m not around, so it’s not a particularly unpleasant sound in general. But I don’t expect everyone to appreciate it and try to keep it to myself in public.   I thought it wasn’t noticeable at work because of the ambient noise level, but when I’m in my office it is quieter. I only have one coworker whose office is near mine, one day she asked me gently to stop humming/be quieter in my office because it was disrupting her.   I apologized and made an effort to stop humming when it occurs, including finding less disruptive stims for the environment and shutting my office door where I could hum quieter. I felt very self conscious about myself for a while as I worked on 1) recognizing when I’m doing it and 2) finding alternatives.   Your supervisor might have felt similarly self conscious when it was brought up, especially if you let her know that you’ve been listening and taking note of when she’s whistling for a while now. I’m not saying that her response was ok, but that it seems defensive. It doesn’t sound like you’re trying to be rude or hurtful about the whistling, it’s like you said, conflicting needs.   Some suggestions based on my experience. Offering her gum or hard candies (if that’s an option) when she’s whistling may work. I also don’t hum when there’s another person humming unless we’re humming the same thing. The stim stops working. Maybe if other people are whistling/humming/singing other melodies in person it will disrupt her. Worse in the short term, but continuing to disrupt her stim might reduce the amount she does it without thinking.   To be clear, you aren’t responsible for figuring out what works for her.

You don't say when the wedding is, but given that the child who will be 5 months old at the time of the wedding is still in utero, that means the wedding is still sufficiently far away that there is time for everyone to sit down, take a breath, and discuss the guest list calmly. His request didn't require an instant response. It would have been better for you to have responded ""I can't think about this right now. I'm not in the right mindset. Let's discuss it when you get back."" What's done is done, but you would be wise not to make that mistake again.  *ive been on edge since.. mainly around making 2 exceptions where other family members may feel this is unfair.*  They WILL feel it is unfair, because it IS unfair. The minute you start making exceptions for one person just because they complained loudly enough, someone else will say ""But what about me?"" And they'd be justified.  *my mother also said it's unfair to allow the 5 month old baby but not allow the baby’s older sibling to come along- said its forcing the parents to split up their kids.*  That's a ridiculous reason. It's not the splitting up the kids that's the problem. Splitting up families was inevitable as soon as you said ""It's a childfree wedding, but we'll make an exception for babies"". Someone with a baby was bound to have an older child.  It's making an exception for your fiance's cousin's toddler that is the problem. The mother of the two children will quite reasonably ask ""Why did that toddler get an exception, but not MY older child?""  *I feel like I have to tell my fiance he’s made it incredibly difficult for me*  He has, and you do.  I'm very concerned that you and your fiance don't communicate well. He lobs a grenade via text message, completely disrupts your peace of mind, and then gets to sit back and say ""Problem solved. All good at my end"" while you're going out of your mind with worry.  You want to know what the least stressful option would be?  Set up a room very close to the wedding venue - one or two minutes' walk from it would be ideal. Stock it with age-appropriate toys and crafts and games. Hire one or more qualified child carers - the number of carers will depend on the number of children. Make this room so appealing that any child in their right mind would rather be doing fun things in this room than be expected to sit still and be quiet at a boring old wedding.  Any parent at any time can leave the ceremony / reception and go check on their kids in this room.  If your wedding venue doesn't have such a room, consider changing it to one that does. A large tent would even do at a pinch.  If your budget doesn't allow for this, then you really do have a problem. You'll either have to say ""NO exceptions except for babies in arms. NONE"", or you'll have to abandon the idea of a childfree wedding.  It's also a problem you should have foreseen as soon as you decided on a childfree wedding.  Note that I am not criticizing you for that choice. It's your wedding, and your choice.  But SOMEONE always wants to push the boundaries of that rule, and if you truly want no children there, you both had to stand firm and not cave in. It sounds like you never committed to the idea firmly enough, or you didn't think it through well enough.

Decide and then hold on to that decision.  You do have to talk to your partner and you and he both have to be on the same page with holding the line.   Bigger issue: that you feel 'lost, scared, and consumed' by all this. That's not how it should be - it should be that you feel joyous about the life this ceremony kicks off. Can you access professional support, like a therapist? Can you talk with your church leader? Can you afford a wedding planner?   In the end, the wedding is NOT IMPORTANT - it's vows + a party. Something about it will be not what you expect, and that's not going to kill anyone. You and your partner's long and happy marriage together is what matters. Try to get some professional support to help you focus on the joy that's waiting for you.  =======   FYI though, your mom is right that if you change your mind, it won't be a big deal. 9 of 10 weddings I've been to, if there weren't kids on the dancefloor, there would be no one on the dance floor. Kids run around all the time, injuries are not that common. Your ushers can help deal during the ceremony, and at the reception, try to have a space where younger kids can run - outside is ideal.

If you and your fiancé are on the same page, it will be much easier.

Jr. Groomsman/Bridesmaid, Usher, etc. It was a tough line to hold, but everyone understood and respected it.  Something you can look into and hopefully won't impact your wedding budget too much... check with the venue and see if they have space/room that you could allow guests to 'drop the kids' off so they are close yet not interrupting the festivities. Either see if there are older kids in the family that want to babysit/entertain the younger ones or tell the parents if they want to bring the kid, they will need to also provide the sitter, and activities for their kids.        As for feeding the kids, talk to the venue and see if they could make some kid friendly plates - nuggets/fries, etc. They don't need to eat what the adults eat, but it should be more than a sandwich.",0,1761080789.0,0,0

Like... if you're ""lost, scared, and consumed by 'what ifs'"" that you're ""desperately trying to manage"" why not just *not make your wedding child free?*  What's gonna happen?  Is this really a time for desperation?  If this is causing you this much stress, the alternative is you just say yes to everybody and maybe feel slightly disappointed that there's a kid on the dance floor?  Sorry, I just don't know what you expected when you had a child-free wedding.  Like, I know it's more common nowadays for people to have childfree weddings.  But, like, I'm a millennial, and when I was growing up, the only times that I *wasn't* invited to a wedding, it was either a situation where I'd never met the bride and groom (they were friends or coworkers), it was a deliberately small destination wedding, or it was a small late-in-life or second/third wedding, where they were trying to deliberately avoid that whole ""big family"" ""white wedding"" vibe.  It was a small quiet late-night secular celebration of the couple and like 40 people in a very nice restaurant.  If there was a DJ and a buffet, kids were invited.  You're struggling right now, because you can't really clearly explain to your mother why you don't want kids at your wedding, or why one is ok but the other isn't.  You're not having an extremely expensive ritzy gala, you're not having one of those ""no dancing we're in a restaurant mingling at 10PM"" adult gatherings.  It's not obvious to others why you don't want kids there other than just *you not liking the children in your family*.  If you don't give a shit about those people enough that you don't want to manage their disappointment about not being included in your idea of the family you want celebrating with you, that's your right.  But the fact that you're struggling with how you're explaining this to people might be a sign that this might be a time where you're elevating your mild preference in a circumstance that's making a large difficulty for people that care about you.

If you can only afford a small wedding with just parents there, fine, but going out of one's way to exclude children... think about it... relatives may already be spending money to come see you, but then they have to pay for baby sitters, or they have babies so small they don't want to leave them alone.   Would a nursing mother feel free traveling a day or two away from the baby?  It depends on the mom some mothers... some parents... are not comfortable with that.    If you do a church wedding, some churches have a cry room or some sort of space for babies outside of the main sanctuary.  How about setting up a room to the side.  Maybe a responsible cousin or two could watch the babies.    Parents would still be close if there are issues.  If you have parents help arrange the wedding instead of doing it alone or with a maid of honor, they might think of these things and help plan it.  Also, who cares if a baby cries or does something cute and funny during your wedding.  I don't.  Most other people probably won't care.   If you are dumping this obligation to find a trustworthy babysitter, pay for the baby sitter, have mammary glands that feel like they are about to pop, having crying baby cousins whining for mommy and daddy far away, just so you can have a 'perfect' ceremony without these precious little babies there.... sure you are paying for your wedding, but why make it so expensive and difficult for countless other people?      You get married and you might have some babies of your own, too, and you might want to take your own kid to someone else's wedding.

That's not retiring, it's just not working.   I would offer logistical and planning support, not money or physical help.       So, I'd use a script like this:   ""I am not in a financial position in my life to help you with money or take the time off to take care of you. But I can help you do some planning, and figure out what's available to you to use.""   She can see if her healthcare covers nurse visits, see if she qualifies for meals on wheels, cook and freeze a bunch of meals ahead of time. She will probably turn these options all down because they require some work from her. But that's the kind of help you should be offering.   Anytime she asks for or mentions money just say ""You should go back to work, you're not even retirement age yet."" You could say ""You chose to prioritize enjoying your life in the moment, instead of planning for old age, and I want to make it clear that I am not going to be able to support you when you run out of money. It's stressful for me to see you not plan for the future at all, and I accept that you are free to make your own choices, but I want to make sure you're not planning on me stepping in when you get older to take care of you.

Don't explain your finances to her. Don't argue with her about her choices. It's so tempting to say ""I don't get to travel like you do, because I save money and am planning for retirement.""

I told her “absolutely not” and got “what am I supposed to do now?”  Before anyone decides to burn me at the stake, let it be known that my childhood was horrible, I grew up almost feral, and joined the military to get away from my mother. My parents divorced when I was a year and a half old. My mother made decent money but gave a lot to church and televangelists believing God would give it back tenfold (I called it the Jesus Lottery and Investment Plan), and another large portion to the QVC shopping network.  I grew up without a lot of things. I worked odd jobs until I was old enough to get a job, but I often lost jobs because my undiagnosed bipolar mother would call up my work screaming at the manager, show up to my job to scream at me, or fake an illness so I would take her to the ER to have some false malady diagnosed and then scream at me because I would want to leave to go to work.  I joined the military at 18, left “home” and began a very successful career lasting over 30 years.  I maintained a relationship with my mother out of guilt. She would beg me to help her manage her money and retirement plans and after I set everything up, she would wait a few months and either cash it out or take out loans she would never repay before retiring. She also asked me several times to giver her an “allowance” to help out.  When she announced she was retiring she also told me “I’ve researched it and I’m going to be declared your dependent so the military can pay for my health care”.  Nope.

Tell her what you will do and what you won’t do. Don’t tell her why.

I can only offer up some suggestions:  Depending on how long she is in the hospital for recovery, if you go to visit her or are there while shes in surgery it might be worth telling someone that she doesnt currently have help at home and you will not be able to be off work to help her. They can get someone up to meet with her (and maybe you depending on how willing she is to get help) and see if she qualifies for any help. She could be released to a care home for physical therapy rehab until she can be home on her own. Or they can try to arrange some home health care. They can also get you in contact with Aging and Disability Resource Center for your area. And this can help beyond just the hip surgery. Qualifying depends, of course, on income and assets but if she only has SS and isnt reporting her other income she should probably qualify.  Unfortunately I dont have much help for the telling her no part, except sitting down and explaining that you just cant afford to take off work to help her right now.

This next part is totally up to you and if you feel this is something you could do. I would then focus on what you are willing to help with. You don’t have to be her go-to caregiver to still help her in some ways. For instance, from now until when she has surgery, you can make extra servings of meals and freeze them so she can heat up a frozen meal in the microwave.

1oclgh8,nknl7xy,Ok-Gap-5262,"NTA. Caregiving is difficult and stressful in and of itself but when you’re caregiving for someone you already have a strained relationship with, it’s a recipe for disaster. It honestly doesn’t matter how your mom spent her money- she could be the most frugal person on earth but if your relationship is strained, taking care of her will be the death blow. I say this as the child of a parent in assisted living- which I pay for in full- who still expects me to be their personal chauffeur, companion, and caregiver and it’s still not enough. Parents like this- who think of their children as possessions rather than autonomous human beings- think children “owe” them care in old age and often end up alone because their entitlement drives people away.  When you talk to your mom, say something along the lines of, “I know you want me to take care of you post surgery but I simply do not have the time and ability. It will not happen but I’m more than happy to help you contact the hospital social worker to see what options you have. This is how I can and will help. Do not ask me about being your caregiver again because the answer is and will be no. If you cannot accept that, that’s fine. I have told you how I can help- will you accept that?” If she continues to push, then leave and tell her you won’t engage in this conversation again even if that means you don’t talk for a while. Come prepared (if you can) with the name and contact info of the hospital social worker- this situation is their specialty- and leave it for your mom. I’ve been in this situation too many times and unfortunately, limiting or ending communication is sometimes the only option for people who do not respect boundaries.   Finally, do not feel guilty because she is your mother. Parenting is beyond giving birth to someone- it is taking care of them, supporting them, loving them. Children do not owe their parents anything and parents who use that tactic are being selfish and emotionally abusive. I say this as the daughter of a lifelong emotionally abusive parent and a mother who is trying everyday to not replicate that cycle. If you want to help, help in the way you can and if your mother cannot accept that, that’s on her and her alone.",4,1761075669.0,4,0

You were essentially left to fend for yourself as a child and you feel no responsibility to provide for her as she was largely not involved in your life and upbringing.

1ock3pd,nkn4itl,CrewelSummer,"Soft YTA  It would have been way better to say, well, basically anything besides ""Because your cat is about to die"".  While that's true, it's not something anyone wants to hear, and does come off a bit like you're waiting for the cat to finally die so you can take your next steps.  And again that IS true, but there are better, equally true, reasons to give like ""My lease is up for renewal so I'm considering my future, and I see a future with you in it, so I wanted to discuss this together"".    Your gf is also being very sensitive, but I'm in her shoes, so I get it.  My cat of 17 years is also in palliative care.  Now I do want to warn you that the palliative care in our case (also cancer) has worked so well that we have been on this track for over a year, and while he's winding down certainly and could crash at any time, as of right now he's truckin like he's got another year in him.  So who knows if this will be a quick decline for her cat or not.    But I will share two things about the experience: first, while I do talk to my husband frankly about my cat's decline, I also try to do so as infrequently as possible.  That's not because I am in denial, it's because I am trying to fully be present in the time I have left and not be dragged down by anticipatory grief.  It may be your gf is also fighting anticipatory grief and is struggling to stay present, so she is adverse to making plans for her cat to be dead in 2 months.  She might be waiting to cross that bridge until she gets there.  And, like I said, while the cat could crash at any time...they also might not.  So it's a bit hard for her to make plans like that when she doesn't actually know what the future holds.  Second is that I am really scared for my cat to pass.  Terrified, honestly.  I have never lived a single day of my adult life without him by my side, and the thought of doing so is scary.  I bet it is for her too.  So you might be hitting that.  The future with her cat being gone might be very exciting to you, but absolutely terrifying for her.  And it's really emotionally jarring to try and make plans for a future that you see as terrifying with someone else who sees it as exciting.  I know my husband did have to recalibrate how he talked about losing my cat to acknowledge the way I was approaching such a future and be supportive of my emotions.",29,1761071024.0,29,0

I went through this exact same thing at your age and trust me it's better in the long run to stand up for yourself and walk away than let these toxic people keep making you doubt yourself at such a psychologically formative time in your life.    My advice is to **quietly** distance yourself from them! Maybe join a club or find a new hobby outside of school or wherever you are around these girls, and use that as 1. a way to make new friends and 2. a way to keep up the appearance of having a busy social life ( as I know teenagers want to represent these days especially using social media), so no one can say anything about you not having friends or whatever.   **Do not** try to have some big come-to-jesus conversation with these girls either, especially Natasha, even though I know you still want to hang on to such an old friendship. It is more than likely in this scenario Natasha will just go running back to Alice and tell her you were ""talking shit"" or whatever else they can use to bond over ther distance from you, and you'll give the two of them more ammo to go be talking shit about you, honestly.    Keep in mind that friendships go through phases and people are changing *a lot* and rapidly during their teenage years. Honestly, since Alice has already proven herself to be a bad friend to you, it shouldn't be long until she treats Natasha the same way. In that case you will have your bases covered to receive Natasha back into your life, both of you having escaped the same toxic friend. However it is also possible that in quietly distancing yourself you will lose Natasha as a friend for good, but let me tell you girl, if that happens, you dodged a bullet because there is obviously some shared traits between them.

So you need to receive that, and instead of clinging to her in the hopes that she will magically change (she will not), you need to let go of a friendship that is not meeting your needs.  This now becomes a conversation with your parents.  It is not healthy to have only 1 or 2 friends.  You need a wider social network than that.  If being homeschooled is not providing you with enough opportunities to socialize and make more friends, then your parents need to help address that.  You need to find opportunities for socialization in other ways, like clubs, hobby groups, church groups, or anything else that will allow you to interact with more of your peers and make friends.
