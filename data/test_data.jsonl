Fast forward to today, and this is where things get messy so bear with me. He married this girl and had two sons with her, neither of which are even 5 yet.

Then his baby mama gets with this dude and since she still had Dwayne’s truck, this guy “repairs” it by basically just messing it up. (Not sure what he did since I’m not a car guy.) So then they’re apparently back together and she lets him see his kids every now and then but she stopped after a while and said “you can see them when I know you aren’t on drugs” because he’s had some issues recently.

One of the prerequisites she gave him to staying here was that he needed a job. It’s been almost a month, and nothing.
