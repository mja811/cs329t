    "title": "AITA for wanting to refuse to help my unemployed brother apply for college cause I am worried how it will affect me?",
    "selftext": "I am (20M) an international Actuarial Science student currently in my third year of study of a 7 year  program. Recently I received a call from my father telling me that he wants my 33 year old brother to join me at school doing the program I am doing as a First year and asking if it was possible for him to apply with his degree and results and if I could help with that.   Some backstory on my brother is that he did go to school for Business Management in my native country but has been struggling to get a job. He wanted to do a masters but that didn't go through, (don't what to bash my brother here but even with this degree he was on and off and would decide when he would go to school or not, this caused him to spend nearly twice as long the duration). After he finished he couldn't find a job and somewhere along the line he gave up I guess.   He has been home doing nothing for like 7 years now. He was being encouraged by my other relatives to find a job, maybe in a different field or least do something in the meantime. Multiple programmes, courses etc popped up during those years but he rejected them saying he wants to do something else.   Back to me now, So after my first year abroad I noticed how my bills and tuition fees where putting a strain on my parents when I would go back on holiday, this continued until one day I overheard them saying they had taken a collateral loan on their car in order to make the deadline for my tuitions. I asked what was going on and they tried to downplay saying that they would always do this when they paid my fees and they had nearly payed back the chain loans. It was always a stressful when due dates would I arrive and I had to call them over and over asking for money.   I felt bad for them and decided I needed to find a cheaper school as this situation was untenable. I spent close to year looking for a cheaper school in the same country till I found it. So I ended transferring from that better school to this one so that at least my parents can breathe and save up for their pension as they quite older. The situation became better but far from ideal, the major stress comes from things like rent and groceries as money is still scarce.   Now fast forward to today, NOW TELL ME WHY DO THEY SUDDENLY THINK THAT THEY CAN NOW DOUBLE THE AMOUNT THEY CAN SPEND BY SENDING MY BROTHER HERE. I thought I had done the right thing by proactively seeking cheaper schools and accommodation so that things are no longer so tight and stressful to the wire. Now if they go through with this idea it will be worse than before and I don't know if I can handle it.   I know I sound so heartless and selfish to my own blood but, I know if they go through with this my living standards will drastically worsen. I already receive no pocket money or anything like that, the only cash I have is from the small saving I have from transport costs when I decide to walk or wait for the evening buses.",

    "title": "AITA for confronting my parents about money",
    "selftext": "My parents make a generous contribution of £100 pounds a month to my child trust fund (I am turning 18 the coming summer) and have done this for several years.  About 2 years ago, my grandma paid £1000 to all her grandchildren (some adults, some not), since her situation meant that she may not be able to make this contribution in the future. Since I was 15 or 16 at the time, my parents took responsibility for the money. Recently, I asked my mum about this money, and when she would pay it into my trust fund.  She said that I was ignoring her generous contribution and that I should treat it as my grandma paying for 10 months worth of my parents contributions. I used the analogy of a child receiving regular pocket money and then upon receiving some money for Christmas, the parents took it, since the child is all ready paid pocket money.. which didn’t seem right to me.  On the other hand, I do recognise that my parents all ready make a very generous contribution. Should I have confronted her about this, and should I again?  EDIT: Let me add some more context.  Roughly around the time of this gift of £1000 pounds, my parents set up premium bonds accounts (essentially government backed savings that are separate to the trust fund) for me, my twin sister, and themselves. My sister’s accounts and mine each had, and still have, the minimum of £25 in. I asked my parents 2 years ago at the time of the gift, to transfer the £1000 to my own premium bonds account, but they said that they would just put it all in a pot in their account (along with their own money). My mum argued it would earn more interest..? I assumed that upon turning 18, £1000 (plus the interest it gathered) would be transferred to me, but apparently not.",

    "title": "AITAH for expecting my husband to set boundaries with his father?",
    "selftext": "Recently my father in law (66) fell and was in the hospital and then rehab for about a month to help regain his strength and balance; nothing was broken or fractured. Insurance denied a continued stay so my husband (35) brought him home this past Saturday. My father in law lives within a 5 minute walking distance from my husband and I so my husband has been there quite a lot recently, which is completely fine and understandable. Also for some background; even though he was denied another week in rehab, my father in law was cleared to leave due to the progress he had made so it wasn’t like he was getting kicked out because he couldn’t walk or anything like that.  Fast forward to this morning when I get up and my husband is already home (he works nights) and tells me he left work 4 hours early because his father called him to come help him because he had to “take a shit.” My husband works 40 minutes away and, similar to most Americans right now, we generally live paycheck to paycheck so I asked him if he went back to work or put in vacation and he said no to both and that he doesn’t have anymore vacation days. I became frustrated and walked away but then my husband asked me to express my frustrations so I was honest that I feel it’s disrespectful on my father in laws part to call my husband at 2:30 in the morning to leave work and drive 40 minutes to help him walk to the bathroom (he can do the rest on his own) and that my husband allows this and didn’t even ask anymore questions like “is it an emergency situation or can you wait a couple more hours?” My husband said he understood my frustrations but wouldn’t want anyone to not be able to use the bathroom when they need to. We just kind of left it at that for now.  My husband is an only child so I know he feels that this burden falls on him but he also regularly was open to me about how it irritated him that his dad only called when he needed something from my husband while my father in law was in the hospital and then rehab.  Am I asshole in this situation?",

    "title": "AITA for not waking my bf multiple times every night?",
    "selftext": "My (26f) boyfriend (40m) and I watch tv nearly every night and usually both of us doze off on the couch at some point. Every night it’s me waking up on the couch, and wanting to go to upstairs to bed. Ofc I wake him up when I wake up, and say something like “ready to go upstairs?” He is cranky and prone to falling BACK asleep every time I wake him up to tell him to come to bed.  When this first started happening several months ago, I used to wait downstairs and shake him a few times, then I used to go upstairs to brush teeth then come back downstairs SEVERAL times until he finally follows me up. I get tired of doing that as I am also tired.   At one point a few months when he didn’t wake up the 2x I tried to wake him, I just stayed in bed rather than going back downstairs 3+ times to force him to come to bed. He came upstairs maybe 30 min later angry at me for “leaving him alone in the dark” downstairs. Mind you, this is his home. I tried to explain that it’s really frustrating that I have to get MY tired out of bed several times on a nightly basis to try to wake him up. He also has a hard time hearing, so it’s not like I can just yell down at him from the bedroom- I have to physically walk all the way downstairs each time i try and wake him.   I’ve tried suggesting we watch tv in bed to avoid this issue, because to him, I should just be inconveniencing myself to make sure HE doesn’t wake up alone on the couch. He doesn’t like to do that often because he likes to smoke and let his dogs out before bed, so he winds up on the couch either way while he does that.   While I’ve been dealing with this issue for awhile, last night was kind of a turning point for me. I woke up around 1am on the couch and shook him a bit until he opened his eyes. I told him 2x I was going to bed. I was super groggy and just not in the mood to baby him, so this time I just stayed in bed once I got all cozy. I was anxious of what was to come. About 10 min later he comes up all angry saying “remember when I told you I don’t like being left on the couch?” and continued to berate me for him being asleep on the couch. I try to explain myself AGAIN and it gets to a point that we’re both heated, but he truly believes I’m in the wrong in this situation. I lost it- I started crying and told him I hated him and slept on the couch.   I sent him a reddit thread of a similar situation, hoping he’d read it in the morning and see why it’s so frustrating from my pov. He woke me up early this morning to take me home, and we didn’t speak at all. When he dropped me off said he expects an apology from me and will wait to hear it. I apologized for saying I hated him and again tried to explain myself and asked if he read the Reddit thread. He said no, he doesn’t give a F what Reddit says. So now I’m laying on my couch frustrated again, writing this.   TLDR; boyfriend makes it my problem that he dozes off on the couch, even though I try to wake him several times before I go upstairs to bed.",

    "selftext": "So I'm friends with this guy that I've known since kindergarten. He got married some years ago and now him and his wife have a little baby girl and she's currently at toddler age. I come over often enough that I'm used to seeing the little bugger and she's great. I don't have any other little kids from family or anything in my life so it's been great seeing a little human grow.   Every once in a blue moon they ask me to watch her for a few hours while my friend and his wife get some date time or whatver they need to do. So I was hanging out with her and I know that they've been trying to get her to take her first steps. I read about a trick where if you make them hold something then they will walk without holding onto a surface. So I gave her a toy and filmed it and it worked!   I sent the video to them and my friend didn't care, he was just happy but his wife was pissed! She was mad at me that they weren't there for that big moment. I don't have the type of relationsbio with her where I can have a deep 1 on 1 with her but I talked to my friend about it and he's not upset with me but his wife still is. She thinks I robbed her if a key moment. I did het it on film but I get what she's saying.   I had no malicious intent but was I the AH for getting the toddler to take those first steps? I hi estoy didn't think the trick would work but it did.",

    "title": "AITA for not texting back?",
    "selftext": "I (26f) and my parents (60s) have had a rocky relationship my whole life. I will spare you all the childhood details, and skip to adulthood. I attended a 4-year university 300 miles away from my childhood home, and have lived independently since. My parents and I, while on speaking terms, have never had a healthy adult parent-child relationship. Additionally, my mental health has always been poor. We have, however, always tried to make efforts to get along and improve the dynamics.  Over the years, there have been multiple falling outs over my decisions. These include things like getting tattoos, coloring my hair, dating outside of my race, and choosing to have cats instead of dogs. I make my decision, and my mother will lash out, express dissapointment, ultimately cry, scream, and throw an adult tantrum in response. I have spent ample time in therapy and individually working through this, so I can set and express boundaries about my autonomy. I do this because I love my family and want to build a healthy relationship with them, despite clear patterns of control-issues.  For context, we now live about 30 minutes apart and speak on a weekly basis. Get together for a meal maybe once a month. I do not tell them much about my life to prevent disagreements and we tend to keep all talk, small.   Background set, here's the AITA scenario: Last night, I went to my state fair. I am not a chronically online person. In fact, my family and friends all know me as the person at any function whose phone is likely either dead, or shut off. I like to enjoy moments more than take photos, videos, etc. At the fair, I left my phone in my car. Maybe you see where this is going.  I got back to my vehicle to several missed calls, texts, social media messages, and even an email. From my parents, my mom in particular. I had not spoken to them in 2 days, at this point. I was at the fair the majority of that day, from the morning until evening. I did not share with them I would be at the fair, in advance. By the time I responded, my father was on the way to my house.  As I read the missed messages, it was clear they were extremely concerned about my safety. With minutes between texts and calls, my mother made statements that \"out of respect, [she] has the right to know if I'm okay\" and that if I did not respond, she would come to my house.  This is not the first time she has threatened this. This is not the first time she has sent my father or shown up herself, unannounced. I have made it known, clearly and calmly, more than once, that it is NEVER acceptable to show up at my house unannounced unless it had been multiple days of no response.  They have been incredibly passive aggressive, since.   I am struggling to determine if their response (showing up at my home after not hearing from me in 2.5 days) was proportionate, or a breech of boundaries. I understand concern. I feel guilty for not responding or telling them I would be busy. But AITA here?",

    "selftext": "The second floor of our apartment doesn't have a door/closed room, there is just a sofa bed, so I guess it would be difficult for the 4 year old to sleep up there. But I still find it unfair that they didn't just get a hotel? They didn't ask for our bedroom but my gf offered it to them, apparently they didn't think ahead. To be fair, we have stayed at their place before, but they have a separate guest house.  What bugs me:  1. I hate having guests sleep in our apartment to begin with, it's my \"safe place\" and we don't have a massive house. Friends are welcome but preferably not overnight, especially not during the week (but at least then I have a place to \"hide\" during the day).  2. I find it a bit gross, even after changing sheets, it's like your bed is not the same anymore.  3. I don't have a safe place to be alone in case of not wanting to be social.  4. My gf's parents already got our bed because of their \"issue\" with stairs, I already thought that was a bit rude of them to ask. So it's not the first time and it's starting to feel unfair.  How many more times do I have to give away our bed? I feel like that just isn't normal, but at the same time I understand that my gf's friends live far away from here and she hardly gets to see them + the kid, who she is really looking forward to.   I guess I gotta bite the bullet and do it for her, but the whole giving our bed to others is a bit too much in my opinion.",

    "selftext": "This kind of is along the property damage lines, however, it’s more along the lines that I think I’m being bamboozled.   I was parking next to someone at a store when my door barely tapped their car. It left a small surface scratch, legit no dent, no paint flake, just a light scuff. A scuff which almost entirely came off with the ol lick of the thumb trick. The owner was actually sitting in the car at the time. I immediately apologized, and she was super friendly, laughed it off, and said not to worry about it as we walked into the gym together.  Still, when I left, I put my business card on her windshield as a gesture of good faith, figured if she changed her mind later, I’d Venmo her a couple hundred bucks for touch-up or buffing.  A few days later she texted me saying her boyfriend owns a body shop and sent an estimate: $3,135.93. The estimate includes full fender repair, bumper removal, radar calibration, and multi-panel paint blending….basically a full collision repair for what’s barely a scuff…..  Now I’m trying to figure out what to do. I find myself wanting to tell her that’s absurd. I want to offer her $500 to settle it fairly..” I feel like I did everything right, apologized, left my info, and offered more than enough for a minor scratch. She even told me it was no big deal when we talked about it, and wouldn’t have my contact info if it wasn’t for my bleeding heart leaving my card. but she and her boyfriend are clearly trying to turn this into a payday.  However, I did hit her car with my door. And want to do the right thing.   I got a mixed bag of opinions from my friends on what they think, from doing nothing and ghosting her- to paying the amount and learning my lesson. So I am turning to Reddit for sentencing. WIBTA for refusing to pay $3,100 and offering $500 instead?    Edit. Here is a link to the photos of “damage” [damage photos](https://files.fm/u/mavbtgycbz)",

    "selftext": "I (30s) recently joined the committee for a community soccer club I’ve played with for a while. It’s a volunteer committee, and they were short on people, so I agreed to help. My friend (also 30s) has been on the committee longer. She does *a lot,* sometimes because she’s passionate, but also because she tends to take on extra responsibilities when others don’t, and because she wants to be important socially at the club.  When I joined, the expectations for my role were described as attending external meetings and helping with legal matters (I have a background in that area). I’ve done those things and helped out on a few other tasks when asked. What I didn’t realise at the time was that there’s an unspoken expectation that committee members should just jump in and help with *everything*. That wasn’t mentioned in the role description, and I'm autistic and struggle to read between the lines. I have been told by others after the fact that they hadn't volunteered because of the amount of work it would be; it was not clear to me before I signed up but I now don't know if I should have known.   My friend and I used to talk every week, sometimes every few days, but she’s recently gone cold on me. She doesn’t reply to messages, seems distant at club events, and I get the sense she’s upset that I’m not doing as much as she thinks I should. She hasn’t said anything directly, but based on past patterns, I know she’s withdrawn from people before when she’s felt let down or overworked.  I feel really sad about it because I value her as a friend and never meant to disappoint her. At the same time, it’s a volunteer position, and I have had quite a tough year personally and could not realistically have done more (to be fair, my friend has also had a tough year, and despite that, has done a lot on the committee).  I haven’t confronted her about it because I don’t know if she’d be honest or if it would just lead to more tension. I’d like to stay friends, but I don’t think it’s fair that she’s freezing me out over something that was never clearly expected.  AITA for not doing more volunteer work than what I signed up for?",
