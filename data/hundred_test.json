    "title": "AITA for telling my mom her boyfriend isn't welcome to events anymore?",
    "selftext": "I, (28F) have recently told my mother her I will no longer be going out to see her at her home, where she and her boyfriend, let's call him Fred, live, and he is no longer welcome to come here under any circumstance. For context, my mom lives about an hour away, and with work schedules and all, we don't see each other too often to start. Now, she and \"Fred\", have been together for about 6 years, and have lived together for about 5, and she made the move out of town to be with him. Since myself and my younger brother were already grown and out of the house already, and she has been seeing him for a year already, they were making plans to move in together, but since his kids were younger, I believe 18 and 16 at the time, it made sense for her to move out there. We were all fond of Fred when she had introduced him, and after her long history with abusive relationships, he seemed like a great change, and we were happy for her. My mom, relocating, didn't know anyone out there other than Fred and his family, and since relocating had to start a new job. Everything seemed fine until fast forward a year or so when his behavior started to change. He is constantly accusing her of cheating (despite never doing so), always questioning her whereabouts, and even makes comments about her weight. So over the years, I would get phone calls of her crying, and saying how she can't do it anymore. Her being my mother, I always tried to help, and even offered for her to stay with me and my family until she found something for herself. But, he'd apologize , and all was forgiven. This has happened about a dozen times in the last 5 years, and always she forgives him, and everything is all dandy again.  Now, fast forward to a few weeks ago. I got one of these phone calls, again, and so did my brother. This time seemed like it was it. So myself, brother, sister in-law and my husband were making plans to get her out and to set her up back here in our town. But low and behold, two days later, he apologized and everything was forgiven, again. So my brother and I had said enough was enough, and if she was ever serious about leaving, we will 100% be there for her, and she is always welcome here to visit, but is no longer welcome, since we cannot pretend to fake nice to a man who treats our mother like garbage. I also have two young children who have started to ask why he says mean things to their grandma, and said I don't want her to model that type of relationship to them. But she has sense said I'm being, quote \"immature, mean, and that is uncalled for since he's 'trying\"\", and is telling other family members I'm trying to cut her out, when I have said she is still always welcome. AITA for saying he cannot come anymore? Or should I just bare it for the sake of not losing my mother and the relationship with her grandkids?",

Saying this, when we are both at home we don’t have issue being in one another’s space, walking our dogs together, cooking together or doing activities together (jigsaw puzzles, art etc) Today she asked me to join her and watch a local boat race and I declined. She then didn’t go because she didn’t want to go alone, and expressed frustration and an annoyance over my constant reluctance to hang out with her and now there is obvious tension between use. She makes me feel like I owe her more of my time. I’d understand if I lived out of home and we didn’t see each other every day, but I don’t believe I deserve to be guilt tripped into spending time with my mother, am I the asshole?",

    "selftext": "Our bins are collected on a Tuesday morning, so we usually put them out on a Monday evening. This is to avoid the hassle of putting them out in the morning or risk missing them being collected in case the binmen come early.   We forgot to put the bin out until I remembered at about 11pm. I brought our bin out and went back in. Bin got collected. Happy days.  My neighbour came up to me and got angry at me because I brought the bin out too late and that it was too noisy when they were trying to sleep. I apologised several times for this and told them that it won't happen again, but they just kept giving out about it and then walked back into their house without accepting it or even acknowledging it.  I went back inside, explained what happened to my fiancee. They think that:  1. They are being unreasonable telling us when we can and can't take our bin out. 2. That they were rude to walk away from me without acknowledging my apology. 3. That if they didn't want to hear outside noises that they shouldn't keep their bedroom windows open (they keep their bedroom window open every night)  I'll be more considerate about this going forward, either making sure to bring the bin out earlier or carrying the bin to the collection point so as to avoid the wheels making any noise, but them getting angry about it to me has taken me back a bit, and I feel like she doesn't like us anymore.  Just wondering what you guys think?",

    "selftext": "My bf &amp; I recently moved in together&amp; are having a bonfire tn with a few of his friends. His ex roommate has been dating this girl on&amp;off the past year or so. Ive had minimal interactions w her but everytime ive seen her in person she says nothing to me unless I say hi first then shell say hi. Shes told my bfs roommate from the get go that shes worried he wants to date me&amp;that im flirting w him. Both my bf&amp; his room mate know this isnt true. My bf and I have a really good relationship&amp; theres never been attraction or flirtation between me&amp;his room mate or any1 else for that matter  Room mates gf has messaged me several times on fb telling me she knows im attracted to her bf &amp; that I exclude her by not saying hi when I see her(shes referencing a time when she didnt hear me say hi&amp; found it rude). She doesnt believe me or my bf when we tell her im not attracted to her bf. She also asked me to stop talking to her bf &amp; i told her im not going to ignore him when im at my bfs house &amp; his rm-mate starts talking to both of us.   She even snooped so far back on my fb &amp; found a post I shared 10 or so years ago &amp; sent it to her bf w no context, asking him if he liked it&amp;when he said yeah she told him i had posted it(It wasnt even my original post, i just shared smthing). Her mssges&amp;stalking my fb were so anxiety inducing at one point I blocked her. She then found me on insta&amp;sent me a message telling me i was petty for blocking her,which I didnt even notice until she screen shot it, sent it to my bf&amp;then blocked him I unblocked her cause I felt bad and to explain why id blocked her in the first place Also she wont say a single thing to me in person &amp;ive invited her to hang w us several times but she never comes  Recently she &amp;her bf broke up. Its happened a couple times &amp; im not super close w my bfs rm-mate so I didnt think much of it until she sent me a message on fb telling me they broke up&amp; asking me if I could find him someone else to date. This is like within a week of them breaking up. I found this really weird and it made me even more anxious. I responded by telling her my bf, who was still living w him, could check on him&amp; left it at that  That brings us to the present. my bf moved in last week &amp; we invited his ex room mate over for this bon fire. I didnt think the gf would be a problem bc they arent 2gether but today he asked if she could come with. my bf &amp; I both said no. He said this made her sad &amp; he might not come  I really dont want her at my hosue. Shes made me so anxious &amp; it honestly makes me feel crazy that she even asked to come w after everything My bf is more chill abt her coming over but hes also supportive of me not wanting to see her  AITA? Should I let her come over? I feel bad that my bfs friend isnt gonna come now &amp; im worried shes gonna isolate him from his friends esp if hes living alone now",

    "selftext": "So I turned 21 this week - my birthday was on the 15th and we hosted a party on the 18th. Th theme was 'dress as my favorite things' and I bought a karaoke machine for the party. I live in a student area where people are frequently hosting house parties, even then I made sure that our karaoke would not run past 11pm - as our council rules define quiet hours as between 11pm-7am. This was something I made sure that the loud parts of the party would stay between.  At about 8/9pm my friends started showing up we started doing our karaoke, at 10:05pm a neighbour I have never met before showed up at the door and was slamming on both the doorbell and the door, I opened the door thinking it was a friend. He then started screaming in my face about his babies not being able to sleep (he was 70/80) before I could apologise he tried to force his way into our house, stepping over our doormat - he only left when my boyfriend stepped in front of me. I know we were being loud, louder than parties normally in this area. we've handled our previous complaints with ease (the only ever other noise complaint I have had is for the flat above mine and I made the complainers banana bread to apologise).  We immediately turned off the music after he left - however I did end up having a panic attack from the way he yelled at me, and ended up calling 101 (the UK non emergency line) as I was shaken by the experience and that's what my mum said to do.   I now have a meeting with a police officer tomorrow, but don't know if I'm overacting or should have held the party at all?",

    "title": "AITA for telling my roommate not to clean the apartment at night",
    "selftext": "I'm living in an apartment with two roommates, so we're three total. Each of us have their own room and we share a kitchen and a bathroom. One of my roommates came back from studying abroad for a year, so he is still often rearranging stuff in the apartment. I probably should mention that the roommate in question is neurodivergent with ADHD, so it is difficult for him to follow a regular schedule.   I sleep very lightly and react very negatively to noise while trying to sleep. Also I really value going to sleep \"early\" (earlier than my roommates that is, anything from 11pm-1am is usual for me) and getting at least eight hours of it. Because of this I've already had discussions with my roommates a few times, because they either don't mind noise or go to sleep very late. I've told them multiple times that it bothers me if they're being noisy at night.  So in this instance I was trying to sleep at 22:45 when I hear my roommate being really loud in the hallway, rearranging stuff and turning on the vacuum cleaner which woke me up instantly. I waited for a few minutes, but when I realized it would be a longer thing I went out of my room to confront him about it. I tried to ask nicely if he could try being more quiet and told him that I don't think it's okay to vaccume this late in the day because I want to sleep and it might bother the neighbours. He responded that he will try to be more quiet but also that he will continue vacuuming at some point this night. He told me that this is the only time he has the chance to do it and he really wants to clean the place. He insisted that his interest in cleaning up the place is just as legit as my interest in sleeping, so I should try to be more sympathetic to him.  We discussed it some more and eventually he did concede to do me a favour, but still thinks he's in the right. In the end I felt quite bad about it and wonder if I am ta for stopping my roommates from doing things that are important to them because of me wanting to go to sleep at a reasonable time.  Edit: for anyone interested, he still makes noise at night, vacuuming, assembling his furniture and so on even though I told him I'm not okay with it. He just doesn't ask me anymore.",

    "selftext": "My mom is upset with me for not wanting to help cook a dinner that I was invited to. I hate cooking, but my mom seems to think I need to help her cook.  Some details that matter: 1) the kitchen is tiny, and there are 4 people in there now 2) my step dad micro manages everything that happens in the kitchen 3) I was invited to eat dinner, not cook it 4) even though my mom is sick and says she cant stand for very long, she is one of the 4 people in the kitchen 5) I dont enjoy cooking  So AITA for making my sick mom cook?  Obviously I forgot some info, only 3 of the 4 are cooking, my step dad is micro managing, my mom is not contagious, she is just having some womanly issues that are causing cramping. My mom will not sit down, she has to be forced down, and there is only room in the kitchen for 2 people to cook comfortably. And I was holding the baby  I find myself commenting this a lot, so im going to put it up here... I would NEVER invite someone over for dinner and expect them to cook it. That is ridiculous. There is a difference between offering to help and being told to help. Also if my mom knew she was going to tell me to help, she should have said that when she invited me. I would have gladly helped if she had said \"the plan is to go pick up dinner stuff, make it together and then eat\" but when she made the plans she said \"we will go get dinner and spend some time together\"",

A month ago, I told her I was going to hang out with a friend (21F). She kept prying for where I was going, how long I'd be out, how many people would come with, and how safe the area would be. I willingly gave her the information so that I could just get to where I needed to be. Until she asked for my friend's name. I always hate that she assigns biases against my friends based on what race she thinks their name is. I've always blatently refused giving out names and explained that I don't like when she makes assumptions of my friends.  I shut her down when she asked for my friend's name, and she called me 50+ times. She said she needed the name for safety reasons in case I went missing. I told her that didn’t make sense since I had my phone and she already knew where I was. I texted that I was busy (because I had arrived and wanted to enjoy myself) and would call her later. She ignored this and continued calling me, so I blocked her. I did not call her back after the event because I was too angry that she disrespected my \"no\" and attempt to set a boundary. She has been ignoring me since for the past month.  I came home yesterday for a medical appointment, and the silent treatment has become more obvious. She does not speak to me directly, and asks my dad to text me like asking if I'm hungry and letting me know she's left food on the table. She ignored my birthday a few days ago, but left a birthday gift in my room. She's been ignoring my texts otherwise, and I continue to act normally despite her silence. I overheard her calling my dad that she wants me to apologize first.   I get that she worries, but this feels more about control than concern. I didn’t feel comfortable giving her my friend’s name, and I didn’t like being called over fifty times after I said no. AITAH for refusing to tell her my friend's name and blocking her?",

    "selftext": "To start, I am divorced as of 2023, I'm 35M, and my ex-wife is 36. We coparent pretty efficiently, and I have my son (13)  every other week; she has him on the other weeks, and on Saturday, we try to do something together as a \"family\" before we send him off to stay with the other parent. I should make this distinction, we parent pretty differently from each other. I'm much more lax so long as he keeps his grades up and stays out of trouble; his mother, on the other hand, is much more hands-on and more of a manager mom to put it in words, for instance, she only lets him play video games on Friday and for no longer than an hour or two, he has a strict bedtime of 9 PM no matter the day, and she cooks all of his food, she doesn't like fast food or anything like that and does not let him eat it. I, on the other hand, do enforce a bedtime of 9 PM on school nights but 11 on Fridays and on Fridays, I couldn't care less if he games for a few hours so long as he makes it to bed on time and has done his homework.  With that out of the way, this week I noticed he was studying a lot more than usual, and he told me he had some tests coming up on Friday: an algebra test, an English test, and a history test. I offered to help him study, and he denied my help and said he could do it on his own. He's generally alright in school, being a B student most of the time. Friday comes, and when he gets home from school, he's super happy, telling me he passed all of his tests and, even more, he aced all of them. I was super proud and congratulated him, and decided to reward him a bit. He had recently been talking about playing a game with me, so I found some games we could play, and we settled on Diablo 3, and I ordered us some pizza. From about 8 PM to 1 AM, we played Diablo, cracked jokes, ate some pizza, and had a fun time. I made sure to tell him that we only played this long, however, because he passed his tests. Come today, and he tells my Ex-wife what he did, and she blows up at me in private and claims I was ruining his diet, sleep schedule, and their relationship, saying he'd prefer me from now on. I argued back, saying it was a reward because he got all A's on his test, and he should get to have fun being a kid sometimes. We went back and forth for a while, but it ended in her calling me an AH and leaving with my son, as it is her week next.  I'm a bit conflicted because I think he deserved to have a reward for this, but I can see how she might see it as me trying to be like the \"fun parent\" I suppose. AITA for this?  EDIT: For everyone saying I’m just a “Disneyland Dad” that isn’t the case. He has structure over here too we just do a lot of the things together and I give him to be a kid. We study together, clean together, cook together, we even make figures and maps for our dnd campaigns together, and we work out together. I didn’t mention it in the original post because I didn’t know the precedent here was useless fathers but here ya go.",

    "selftext": "My 18 year old daughter and I were watching a film together and during the ad break, I told her I went to school with one of the lead actresses in it and talked to her a couple of times. My daughter was interested and asked about it. She asked did I ever try to become friends with her back then and I said no.  When she asked why, I admitted that my interactions with her in school weren’t the nicest. She was on the heavier side and I made jokes about her weight like calling her a pig or calling her too heavy. I said I know it was wrong and I wouldn’t do it again. When my daughter asked why, I just said it was puberty and some of my friends including my bf at the time were doing it too, so peer pressure.  My daughter’s tone changed and she seemed to go on the offensive against me. She called me a bully and said what I did was cruel. I was caught off guard but decided to try and defend myself. I explained I never went out of my way to hound her and at the time I didn’t really think she was too bothered by it besides a few annoyed looks, she never really seemed upset about it (I know bottlers do exist but this is from my younger self’s perspective), if she told me what I was saying was upsetting for her I would have stopped. She asked what did I get out of it, I kinda snapped back saying I was 12-14 at the time and it’s common for people to be bitchy and less considerate at that age. She snapped back in a cheeky way saying she never bullied anyone and asked was it hard for me not to consider how she felt. I told her to calm down. I repeated myself saying I never went out of my way to hound her and that this was decades ago and I highly doubt this actress who is now a millionaire and has kids, is still scorned by some comments from some random classmate. I laughed a little to calm the atmosphere down but I think this agitated her. Again she asked what did I get out of it and I told her again I didn’t bully her, like I said I never hounded her about it, outside of a few agitated looks she never seemed upset and I didn’t interact with her much in general either and I also mentioned if she thinks what I said was bad then she wouldn’t want to know what some of my friends circle at the time said about her. I told her to watch the film but she refused saying I’m an awful person before leaving. I tried to ask her to talk for a minute but she told me to leave her alone.  I don’t particularly know why she’s acting this way. I did say I regretted it and I was 12-14 when I said these things and it was decades ago. Yes I obviously wouldn’t have done this again and I didn’t do it as I matured. I don’t think I bullied her, I didn’t go out of my way to hurt her and never spoke to her again after it. I don’t think my daughter has ever been bullied in school.  AITA for trying to defend myself over this?  As an update: We've talked about it. She was upset by how nonchalant I came across and how I didn't come across as feeling bad about it. I didn't want to include this in the post because it's personal but both she and I are both overweight. She didn't start putting on weight until she was 13-14 and by that time she had a solid friends group and was popular in school but she did say she was teased a bit about it and felt self conscious. So I can understand better why she was upset.",

For context my sister in law is (F21) and always has her pets wherever she goes now she is aware of my allergies as I mention it often when I first meet people as an ice breaker and recently we have had her sister in law and a few other family members over now many bring their dogs and pets to the house but my only rule is that they take care of their waste and manage their pets.   So it all started when my sister n law decided that it was a good idea to bring her dog and her cat which I don’t mind but I was hoping for her to be mindful about my allergies and how it could potentially be bad for me. I noticed that every time she came over I would always break out and often go to the other room to avoid that malicious cat that always tried to rub up against me as I didn’t want to spend the whole day rubbing my eyes out.  Long story short the cat started to run around and even got lost a couple times each time my sisters family left there was always cat hair everywhere or dog hair (now I don’t mind dog hair as I used to have dogs and know that it is inevitable) now I mention to my partner to tell her sister to not to bring the cat as I notice that even once their gone I find pee stains and the noticeable smell of cat pee without being to speciesist I told her to tell her it’s because of my allergy’s not because I don’t like cats.  My partner said that her sister took this personally and has not spoken to her after they got in an argument how everyone else gets to bring their pets but they’re just targeting her. I feel bad for my partner as they are close and I didn’t mean to upstir any drama I cant help feel like the a hole, what do you guys think?",

    "title": "AITA for setting boundaries with my overly emotional best friend?",
    "selftext": "I 22 F have a close high school friend, we are very different   She is extremely emotional and expresses love through words while I’m more rational and prefer to show love through actions.  I still say things like “I love you “ or “miss you “ or “ glad to have you in my life “ but not always but for her she always feel that I am cold hearted because I don’t say stuff like I can’t live without you or i will never leave you   But I don’t want to lie because I believe that people come and go you love them but that’s not guarantee that you will never lose them. I lost my dad couple years ago and alot of people that I love so what I learned from that is that people come and go for different reasons and ether they want or don’t   But from day one she doesn’t accept my way to show love and my believes even though I explained that I express love through actions and that doesn’t make it any less and I always want people to be in my life because they choose not because they feel obligated or emotionally dependent .  She always expects constant communication like 4 to 5 days a week and each call has to be minimum 2 - 3 hours   I don’t usually mind that but I’m student in medical field and had alot of things to do like housework or freelancing or studying so even if I had some time I would be so exhausted and don’t have emotional energy to listen to her problems ( which are alot ) and that makes me feel like she treats me like her unpaid therapy   I talked to her before about this and I gently told her that our friendship felt one sided and that sometimes sounds like she only came to me when she had issues and I didn’t mind we talk alot but I don’t want most of the talk to be about negativity and problems because it’s draining specially if she starts the drama and then come to complain about it.     and she pulled away for a bit.   Eventually she came back and although she started her calls with “I don’t want to bother you, but…,” she’d still go on talking for hours about her problems again.    Recently she called me multiple times while I was out   So I texted her saying that I was busy and will call her later and asks if she’s okay ( usually if don’t reply she will call my siblings and friends to ask them about me ) she got upset saying I used to answer even if I’m outside and she feels that I have changed and didn’t care about her anymore.  I told her I will talk to her later and when I got home I was mad so I snapped and told her she needed to stop trying to control how I show love and I’m tired of constantly proving I care and that I have life outside our friendship and she has to respect that like I do to her.  Maybe I was a bit harsh but I honestly felt drained.     Now she says I’m cold and distant but I feel like I just set a healthy boundary after years of giving more than I got back even though she believes the opposite     So Reddit …. Aita for finally standing up for myself and ask her to respect my space ?",

    "selftext": "For simplicity I’ll use fake names for my brother and his girlfriend.  Jack (M19) started dating Ellie about a month ago or so. My parents and I (M26) were quite excited since this is the first real girlfriend he’s ever had. Finally, he decided to introduce her to us last Thursday.  When she arrived, we quickly noticed that Ellie is blind. I had to say I was a bit shocked by this. “She’s blind” seems like the type of thing you would say to someone before introducing your girlfriend, at least to be prepared.  Passed the initial shock we went on with dinner. We learned a bit about her and she did seem quite nice. At one point Ellie mentioned that they meet at university. So later, to fill an awkward silence, I asked her “and does Jack help you around university a lot?”. I thought this would be a chance to let him show off how kind of a partner he was, but instead they both remained silent. Jack then asked me what I meant and I tried to explain. “You know, like guiding her around campus or taking notes for her”. He got quite defensive and said that “she doesn’t need any help”.  I didn’t think much of it at the time, but the next day Jack was noticeably cold towards me. When I asked what was wrong, he said I was insensitive towards his girlfriend. I think this is bullshit, it was an innocent comment and I was trying to help him. I’ve tried to explain that to him but he doesn’t relent. It’s been two days and he’s still mad at me.",

    "title": "AITA for “making fun” of my boyfriend’s best friend?",
    "selftext": "So I, 23F, and my BF 24M, have been together for about a year. We have not had much issues. In fact, we normally, (especially when it comes to issues as such), do very well and I love him very much. Today, he told me that one of his best friends, Jason (fake name), is coming over. We don’t live together &amp; so I told him that I would head to my parent’s place for the day&amp;evening, to give them time together bc I know what it’s like to have a friend visit who rarely does. As I was getting ready to leave, my bf tells me that Jason said, “I’m on mi way!”. And if anyone has been on the internet/involved in pop-culture, you know either the joke/spongebob reference to Mr. Crabs/ the Mrs. Doubtfire joke where Mrs. Doubtfire says, “HELP IS ON THE WAY DEAR!”. Once his friend texted my bf that, I made a joke saying, “haha! I’m on mi way dear!”. And for reference, I do have adhd+autism and have a tendency to hyperfixate on a saying or joke as a way of stimming. It was my fault for not looking at my bf’s face when I was making the joke and repeating it. Bc I assumed that he understood I was making a joke. And also wrongfully assumed that Jason was, over text as well. When I looked up, I got a lecture about how I’m mean and a cruel human-being for making fun of someone and how that is my bf’s very best friend. I apologized but explained how it hurt my feelings that my bf thinking that I would make fun of his best friend, (which I have never done in the past to ANYONE let alone his best friend) hurts. And that he would think I would genuinely do that. I would never make fun of another human being like that and could understand apologizing if I did that to Jason in person if he was offended, but my boyfriend was the one offended and he didn’t tell his best friend. If I’m the a-hole to my boyfriend for doing this please let me know so I can apologize. Thank you!",

    "selftext": "I (31 m) and living with fiancé (30f) for a few months now. We very recently left her old place to live in a new apartment - so things aren’t as tidy as they could be right now.  I noticed that recently, hair brushes seem to get left in the bathroom, forgotten about, then a new one would show up. So now there’s three hair brushes in the bathroom when they are usually in the bedroom.   As I go to shower I go up to her and in a joking manner I say something like “why do your hairbrushes keep spawning in the bathroom”. I’m not great with my tone sometimes and I’m trying to be more kind when things bother me so I make sure to add at the end that she looks beautiful as she’s getting ready to go out.   I leave her, go back to the bathroom, take the hairbrushes and put them on the kitchen counter, shower.  When I get out I’m met with an argument about why I took the hairbrushes out. I ask is it really a big deal? This is such a crazy thing to be mad at be about, I wasn’t mean to you I just took them out of the bathroom, you have no reason to be upset etc… I walk away. Now I’m in the doghouse even more because I don’t care about her feelings. I feel I really try my best to be kind and respect feelings even if I don’t agree with them but I shouldn’t be made to apologize or feel bad when I did nothing wrong and I feel like she’s overreacting (this has me in the doghouse even more.)

    "title": "AITA for asking my mom to move out?",
    "selftext": "I’m (f,30) living in perpetual stress with my mother(f, 58). Back after my father passed away she was living with my brother but, for what I’m assuming are the same reasons, he asked her to leave his house. I am the family people pleaser/glass child so when she came to me asking for help I did, not realizing what I was getting myself into.  We decided to buy a house with the life insurance money that my father purposely left to my brother and I to use to take care of my mom, assuming he didn’t trust my mother with that large sum of money. She did not qualify for the loan as she was only working contracting jobs and had bad credit so I took out the loan in my name using her allotted portion of the life insurance as the down payment and 8k of my own money.  The agreement was that we’d split everything down the middle so that my partner and I could save up to buy our own house and we’d also be helping her pay off this one for her to keep, it was a win-win. 5 months later she stopped working and has paid maybe 4 months of the year for the last 6 years.  There are other serious issues aside from financial, including her continuously bringing stray cats and dogs home that she can barely afford to feed even though my partner is severely allergic only to have them either disappear or die leaving her in emotional shambles. The cats she keeps inside don’t have a litter box so I have no idea where they use the restroom in her room, but they come out and pee on our kitchen appliances and wooden countertops sporadically making our house smell bad. We try and stay in our rooms or hang out outside because of this, god knows how she sleeps and eats being in the middle of it. She has our garage filled and spilling out into our yard with things shes collected from the side of the road, her old houses and from my grandmother’s house after she passed away.  My partner and I have since had a baby, I’ve stopped working to stay home with him and finish my degree. No change from my mother despite promise after promise, no help financially and she still only works sporadic jobs. Now we are fed up, can no longer afford to support her financially and need to downgrade to an apartment until I can return to work.  We are planing to rent out the house so we don’t lose it entirely, but she’s refusing to move out. I’ve had to give her a 30 days notice so that I can then evict her because I know she won’t leave willingly. She’s obviously furious with me, but I feel like I’ve given her so many chances and I need to finally put my foot down and put my family above her. She’s got narcissistic tendencies so she doesn’t see anything she’s done as wrong, she won’t apologize and she will make me the villain to everyone who will listen to her.  Despite all this, I feel bad. I love my mom and before this we had an amazing relationship, or so I thought.  AITA? Is there another solution I’m not seeing?",

    "title": "AITA For buying my sisters storage unit",
    "selftext": "So my older sister (35F) told me that a while back I could have my grandparents old dinning set she received from my mom for free, and I (23F) was planning to move it into my storage unit. I had texted her the other day about how I need a good time to come get that stuff out and want to move it. My sister had started the conversation with “oh I’m too busy this month, I can’t meet up with you.” I told her no big deal, that I would need a heads up of when to get the dinning set out of it and when to meet up. My sister finally tells me that she has been 4 months behind on the payments and can’t get access right now. What makes it worse is that she said in 3 days they were going to auction it off and she didn’t know what to do. My sister’s stuff that was sentimental for her was going to be gone and I felt bad. She then brought up that she couldn’t ask either of our parents cause they basically cut her off financially which is understandable. Anyway, my sister was going on a rant about how no one can help her and decided to step in. I had offered to pay off the storage unit but I would need it in my name. The payment was $360, and I wasn’t about to not hand over a bunch of money and not at least have some ownership of this storage unit. She agreed and I also went ahead and paid for next month to be on the safe side. I then sent her a message regarding what I need to happen. First I need my sister to pay me back all my money before she is allowed access to her unit, second she has to have cleaned out 10 days before the end of the next month. I found these terms reasonable and told her them. I haven’t heard a thank you from my sister and only that I was a shitty person to tell her that she can’t have access till she pays me back. Am I the asshole?  *Update/clarification*  My sister has a long history of lack of responsibility with her financial actions. She splurges on shopping and recently got a fixer upper house which is rent own. She currently lives with my dad, rent free, and her new house is a hour away. Her only major bills are; car, car insurance and phone. I love my sister but with all her recent actions and her getting mad that non of us have time or resources to help her fix up her new house, she has alienated us. I’m putting myself through college at the moment and saving for a house with my boyfriend, I don’t have that much money to help my older sister out with stuff like this. This discussion was over a couple of days and she was ok with my terms of the deal before she signed over the storage unit.     *Second update*  If anyone was interested or wanted to know, my sister has decided upon herself to buy a 2018 F-150.  And I received a text saying that she can’t pay me back cause she had something come up. I told her I know about the new truck and the agreement doesn’t change. I understand the sentimental things but I need to pay for school and my bills. And a side note, as far as I know she is going to try and give her car to her ex-husband and I don’t think that’s gonna work out how she wants it to.",

    "title": "AITA for wanting my friend to take accountability for the way she's treated me?",
    "selftext": "I (M18) and my best friend (F18) have been close friends for the past 2 years. For context, I really adore this friend, as she is smart and really sweet. We spend almost everyday talking to each other, and it's been like this for the past year or so. We've also had several fights in our friendship, often of which I would were my fault Things such as me not respecting her eating disorder properly, to other things which I fully claim fault over and have done my best to work on over the years. Needless to say, she is a very important friend in my life.   Recently, I began to realize that I do not feel very respected in our friendship, to the point where I often see myself shutting myself down with her as compared to others. Realizing this, I decide to send her a really long essay about my feelings and how she's made me feel. Some of my points included:  \\- She's ignored or brushed off some of my attempts to help her, such as one time where I stayed up to write her bullet points on her college applications, which was met with absolutely 0 response.   \\- She's often left me on read or just not acknowledged my comments, which is something I have mentioned to her numerous times. She also does not seem to care much about things I find interesting, despite me doing my best to do so otherwise.    For context, I do not believe she intends to be like this. I think it's just her not understanding how the way she talks can make a person feel, and all I wanted for her was to take accountability, go \"I'm sorry, I'll work on it for you\" and move along in our relationship.    However, her response to the essay was that she's sorry, and that it hit her to her core. She also then went on to tell me that she believes there something deeply wrong with her, hence why she acted the way she did. In response, I tell her whatever it is I would help and be there for her, &amp; before she left she asked me if she's a bad person, to which I clearly responded with  \"No\" (this is important)    The very next day, however, she suddenly begins to get really mad at me for a random situation I had &amp; the way I was being attacked made me realize this is personal. I ask her what's wrong, and she says that she believes I see her as a horrible person who needs to be fixed by me. She claims that \"maybe you just bring the worse in me\" (which hurt btw) and asks why she's even bothering to stay in the friendship because it seems like I always have a problem with her. I have told my friends about our situation, and a lot of them told me to straight up leave the friendship (which I don't want) so I do not think I was unjustified for being upset in the way I was treated. It honestly feels like she decided to victimize herself the first day, then get upset at me for thinking she's a bad person when I absolutely never said that. I feel like I'm being emotionally manipulated sometimes, but It could also be me missing out on something that maybe I don't get unless I hear it from someone else. AITA?",

    "selftext": "We agreed on a strict e1/e2 campaign &amp; then the DM slow dripped changes to create an OP game so we could level up very quickly. DM tells us the AC of unfamiliar monsters so 'speed up the game', gave out high level magical items on the first couple games, allows numerous spells/day with no learning or success roles for even 1st level magic users, added unlimited use of 'cantrips' which are as or more powerful than even the spells given, no penalty for halflings wielding weapons larger than their body, asked players what their goals were so they could 'sprinkle magical items along the way to enable the player's goals', and having at least one 18/19 ability, and on and on.  After mentioning for weeks that giving AC for unfamiliar monsters removes most of why i play the game, as well as the OP in general, I decided to allow my temporary schedule change to be permanent in order to leave the game without calling anything out. I told the DM before we began that I only wanted to play a strict e1/e2 campaign and, even though all the others seem to be having fun with endless low-effort treasure &amp; seemingly no thinking part of the adventure, I spent more time being annoyed and bored than enjoying the game.  So AITA for fading away? No amount of asking to slow down, figure stuff out, drop my character's ability to use magic has had any effect.

    "selftext": "So this all started around 4 months ago when my friend started crushing on a guy in our uni campus, we were walking around (we have many unis in the same campus) and we went to a different part of the campus nearby and we saw 2 super cute guys walking together towards their uni, she saw them first and quite literally fell in love, maybe youll judge us for this but for the next week we kept “accidentally” bumping into them until eventually they came up to us and we started talking, exchanged numbers/socials and we started talking to them and hanging out with them all the time, to cut this short in my country theres only 1 very specific way you can talk to a guy unless you want him to think you are cheap with no dignity, it sounds bad but its the truth, she would regularly ask me for advice and id give it to her, she would never listen, i would tell her to never ever sexually flirt, not respond immediately ALL the time, not be overly caring and clingy etc etc, all was fine until like 3 days ago she went back home after she went out with the guy and she called me crying, i asked her whats wrong and she started begging me for advice bc the guy asked her if she wanted to book a hotel next time and she didnt know what to do, i was obviously furious at the guy for even daring to suggest that, but i was also very upset at her bc i would always tell her to never sexually flirt with him bc he will get the wrong idea and he wont understand that she doesnt really mean it, i stayed quiet then eventually said “i wouldve said block him but its not like you listen to me, i understand that hes hot but the second you started saying such things of course he will think this is normal for you” (i dont want to specifically say what she said but im pretty sure you get my point) we got into an argument and now we are trying to figure it out, however i do feel bad bc i was quite harsh with her, so aita?",

I find it incredibly rude and entitled, especially considering everything my dad does for her.  I’ve reached the point where I’m thinking of making it clear that from now on, I’ll only be cooking for my dad and my siblings and that she and her husband won’t be getting any food I make.  I know her husband is sick, but the lack of gratitude and basic decency is unbelievable.",

    "title": "WIBTA For taking a cat?",
    "selftext": "So I have been feeding a small colony (5 or 6) of stray cats since about June of this year. About 5 weeks ago, a very young looking cat showed up, eating everything in sight. Day after day this poor baby would come around like clockwork. Over several weeks I earned her trust and started petting her. One day maybe 2 weeks ago she crawled into my lap and wanted pets and I saw that she must be a nursing mother. In the weeks I've been feeding her she hasn't gained any weight so I know if she has kittens they are at least 5+ weeks old at this point.   2 days ago I didn't see this cat for dinner. Odd. The next day I go around the neighborhood looking to see if I could find her, thinking the worst... Hoping she wasn't injured somewhere nearby. There is a house a block away from me that has a cat problem... Strays, their own cats, etc inside and out. I walk up to the man sitting on the porch and ask about the kitty. He says, it's his cat.   This cat that I've grown quite fond of... She is starving to death. Can see every single bone in her back, hips, everything. She has been around my home for like last month and a half at least. This man obviously is not taking care of her. So... If I see her again I was thinking of taking her in my home. WIBTA if I \"take\" this cat?   Edited to add!!!! My thought is, she is not fixed (obviously) so therefore there would be no microchip. She also is very young, not even a year old. Just a kitten herself that had kittens. She was very much outside left to the elements for 5/6 weeks now, who knows how she was feeding her babies. And my last thought is... If I do steal/take her, the kittens would be ok as they would be AT LEAST 5+ weeks old and not totally 100% reliant on Mom's milk.",

    "title": "AITA for not telling my coworkers that I’ve been buying cheaper gifts secondhand ?",
    "selftext": "I (33F) work in a small team of 4. My coworkers are obsessed with giving gifts for literally every single thing. Birthdays, new babies, new houses, someone sneezes too hard – there’s a gift.  We usually all chip in like $20–$50 each depending on the occasion. Since I’m the only one without kids, apparently I “have more time” so I’m always the one who has to collect the money and actually go buy the gift.  Here’s where it gets a bit dodgy.  Instead of going to the shops, I started buying stuff from Gumtree ( Aussie version of craiglist) or Facebook Marketplace. People sell brand new things they got as “unwanted gifts” all the time, way cheaper than in stores. I only buy new things still in the box, so no one ever notices the difference.  Example- We decide roughly on a gift , e.g gardening stuff for a house warming. I go and find something on marketplace that's new and then I find the RRP on an actual shop website then we raise the money 5 ways. So website store price is 200 is 40 each but the Gumtree is like 130.    I use it for coffees, snacks for the team, and sometimes petrol when I’m driving around picking things up. So it’s not like I’m stealing, right? Everyone kinda benefits.  Anyway, problem now is one of my coworkers asked for a receipt for the electronic photo frame thing I got her for her maternity leave. It broke after a few months and she wants to return it.  There is no receipt. It was from Marketplace. I told her I’d “check my emails” but now the team’s asking about warranty and all that and I’m lowkey panicking.  If I tell them the truth they’ll probably think I’ve been pocketing money. But if I hadn’t been doing this we’d have all spent way more over the years, and honestly no one else ever volunteers to organise this stuff.  I’ve saved them heaps of money and done all the running around. I just figured not chipping in was fair since I’m doing the work.  So… am I the asshole for buying “new but secondhand” gifts and keeping the leftover money for team stuff and petrol?",

    "selftext": "Hi, I (F21) had an online friend (M19) for about a year and a half. We met through a game and used to play together all the time - until he confessed his feelings for me. After that, things got awkward and we stopped talking for like 4-5 months.  About a month and a half ago, he reached out and asked if I’d like to join him and his friends for a game. I agreed, thinking he got over his feelings and that things would be normal again. For a while, it actually seemed fine - he wasn’t guilt-tripping me anymore, so I thought he’d changed.  But I was wrong. Over time, all the old patterns came back - and even worse. He kept saying what a horrible person he is, how much he hates himself, how he doesn’t deserve friends, etc. It got exhausting. I felt like I had to walk on eggshells every time we talked, just so I wouldn’t trigger another round of self-pity.  Other people we played with also tried to cheer him up and change his mindset. When he left mid-game over some small issue, they would always reach out to him - even though he ignored everyone. Honestly, I found it miserable to watch.  Yesterday, we planned to play together one-on-one. I wanted to see if maybe he could change, so I gently suggested he talk to a therapist and try to work on himself. I also told him I can’t keep being his emotional dumping ground. He said he doesn’t want to change and sees nothing wrong with how he is.  At that point, I decided I’m done. I told him honestly how I felt and explained why I can’t keep doing this. He didn’t reply, and now he’s apparently cut off from everyone else too, acting like his life is over.  So… AITA for cutting him off?",

    "title": "AITA for calling men “errand boys” and joking that they should help around the house?",
    "selftext": "So I (late 20s, F) live with my three best friends. We’ve all seen each other through every kind of man: relationships, situationships, talking stages that should’ve been deleted after about two weeks…you name it. For the first time ever, we’re all single at the same time and now we sit around analyzing men like it’s a group project! So much “relationship talk”, what we want in partners, laughing about dating patterns, bad habits, etc.  I have this running joke that the ‘guys’ we date (or situationship with) should at least help out a little when they’re over. Yk at least contribute to the household ecosystem. Take out the trash, kill a bug, drive someone to work. Small things.  I call them “Errand Boys” in a teasing way because honestly, a lot of men barely do the bare minimum. But apparently, that name really irritates my roommates.   Example 1 Roommate A: Her guy spends the night. I say “If he’s going your way, let him drop you off at work.” She’s like “Nooo I’ll just Uber.”  After him already offering a ride  Girl… he literally just spent the night. Asking him to drive you two miles isn’t exploitation.   Example 2 Roommate B  #1 Hater of the ‘Errand Boys: She’s been in a year long situationship. He occasionally takes out the trash (a king, I knoww) but that’s about it. One time I asked him to kill a bug and he looked at us to do it. (This man is a firefighter. Like be SO for real) So later when I saw him taking out the trash, I joked “Omg thank you! We could really use help in the backyard too, we’ll even pay 👀.” Roommate B got heated. “You can’t force men to be your errand boys! If he wanted to, he would!” I’m like okay, true… but sometimes people just need direction! But also you’re not even dating! what are you expecting from him? I’m not chaining anyone to a mop bucket! I’m just asking for basic participation!   So now this whole “Errand Boy” debate has been an ongoing kerfuffle in our house.    Fast forward to tonight: Roommate A’s ex (who used to live with us) came over. When he lived here, my ex and I were together and always around, so us three did all the dishes back then. I joked, “For old time’s sake, maybe you should do the dishes since you’ve been dogging about how the place looks.” Later when we all came back home, he actually did start the dishes. Like… then finished the whole sink. I said something like “See? Isn’t that nice sometimes? I want more errand dudes” just teasingly and my roommates freaked out. They said I “force men to do things” and “guilt them into chores” That it’s manipulative or whateverr.  Meanwhile, I’m standing there like… he literally did it on his own?? I didn’t guilt him, it was a lighthearted joke and he chose to help. He literally volunteered?  So AITA for joking about men being “errand boys” and expecting small acts of help?",

    "selftext": "So this happened maybe a month ago but the fighting between my(17F) mom(44F) and my dad(45M)  has been going on for years. A month ago my mom started working in a factory, at that time my dad and mom was already fighting alot and my dad didn't talked to my mom much beside work. She told us that she will go out for lunch with some co-workers on weekend (she said co-workers were girls)  My dad was already suspicious so he left before my mom did for groceries and after a couple of hours he return home angry, he was screaming and he told us that he followed our mom and she got into some man's car. Now for reference we know who the man is, he was my mom's previous boss. He used to call when he had a cleaning work and picked my mom up from our house for work, my dad also worked for him a couple of times. And he was at our house for dinner just the day before my dad caught my mom, my mom invited him. So my dad was even angrier, he called the man threatened him that he had his plate number and if my mom didn't come home in 5 minutes he will call the cops on him.   İt was messy and there was a lot of screaming when my mom got home. After that they separated but my dad told my mom that if wanted to stay in this house for me and my sister she can but she will have to give up her phone or she can leave. My mom said she have to think and my dad gave her 3 days. After that my mom tried to convince my dad saying she needed the phone for her work and stuff, he can take the sim card so my dad agreed he gave the sim card to me and said that i was responsible for my mom's phone i have to keep an eye on her when she was at home using phone.   İn that time he was constantly reminding us that she could leave at anytime so we shouldn't relay on her for everything, and we should be distant from her. He was saying bad things about her constantly. When i asked my mom why she did it, why she didn't think about us she said she thought about us that's why she was with him for years. My dad is a very controling person but we are in a foreign country and we have some financial problems that makes divorce impossible.  For context my mom used to do TikTok live for money and it was my dad's idea but when she started making friends there he told her to not do it but my still talked to her friends after. My mom told me that she tried to cut all contact with everyone and be a good wife to my dad but my dad told her that he was gonna do a second marriage no matter what either she live with the new wife or leave so my mom cheated.  İ am not justifying her cheating but they both were in the wrong so i didn't pick sides. Now let get to the problem. Me and my mom both are obsessed with a k-pop boy band Stray kids and we watch there content and videos together when she comes home, and I've noticed my dad doesn't like it he is making comment's constantly about being on phone 24/7 and create extra work for me so i don't watch videos.

    "selftext": "To start with context, I am a very unathletic young woman. Been told many times I “can’t catch a cold” lol. Since I was a kid I’ve warned ppl I was on a team with (gym class or Freindly tennis/basketball matches) that I will not be helpful to the game but will def try my best and hope our team wins.  Still, if men are on the team they would seem to often yell or have rude banter with each other and even amongst their own team? There were a couple times I was yelled at with vulgar language by ppl I was not close with in a rude tone and/or the tension built up to a point I was uncomfortable with (I’ll admit can I be sensitive), so as an adult I’ve tried to avoid those types “friendly matches” if men are involved.  Now, as an adult woman (23) with a boyfriend (23) I see this still when he drinks with friends, but all levels of “games”, not just physical but any game we play. Friendly games on the Wii or Switch turns to them pushing each other and  kind of wrestling without going all out? And then if I’m playing and winning my partner tells me to “fuck off” in a tone that does not feel like our normal playful banter.  It’s one thing when the men do it amongst themselves which already kind of makes me feel weird bc I just want everyone to get along, but then when I’m involved and they start talking to me and I don’t reciprocate and simply say, “hey, can we all stop being mean and just play the game?” “I just want a chill game guys let’s be cool” “don’t talk to me like that” “good job” “that was a nice one” etc… (in my opinion a good mix of positive sportsmanship and setting some mf boundaries) they keep on talking to me rude asf. Tonight, during a game night that played out similarly to how I just described, I made the comment “you guys are making this game a lil too serious to be fun” and I geuss that offended my partner. He told me I’m just not compatible and should “get over it” and “if you don’t like that, you just don’t enjoy playing games” is this maybe a normal thing between men that I just don’t understand? Are there better ways for me to say I want to play games during a game night, but that I’m not a dude and don’t want to be treated like one?  TLDR: I don’t like how men talk to each other and ME when they play any type of game and am unsure if this  relentless trash talk is just a difference between the sexes or how any given “competitive” person acts and maybe I’m just not competitive and should not play games at all",

The lane was upgraded to have some small concrete barriers between it and the car lane but unfortunately this barrier isn't all along and only near each intersection. Sadly cars still park in the unprotected areas especially delivery drivers like doordash.  A door dash driver parked in the opposite side bike lane suddenly drove into my lane at 90 degrees to do an illegal u turn, there is a solid line so you cannot even pass in the oncoming lane.  I did not have time to completely stop and hit the door of the car head on. I was fine and so was the bike but my helmet got a dent from hitting the car window.  He got out and started shouting at me and telling me that I am an asshole and should have just stopped and waited for him to turn and that I did it on purpose and he saw me.  The car door had a massive dent from the impact. He then said this is going to cost a lot of money and told me I would have to pay for a new door.  He was still blocking the road and some other drivers started honking so he moved the car to park in the bike lane.  I asked for his insurance and said he is the one who owes me a helmet and he declined to give me anything.  I started to just cut my losses and cycle away but he got in his car and followed me.  We stopped elsewhere and I gave him my phone number and took his.  Now he is calling me and sending me threatening texts about suing me if I do not pay him for a new door.  AITA for refusing this?",

    "title": "AITA for asking my mom to stop cleaning my room?",
    "selftext": "I (29 F) moved back in with my parents  a few years ago after a failed engagement.  For context- No, I am not freeloading, I pay more rent here than I have in any of the 3 previous apartments I’ve lived in the past 12 years. I also have OCD, and am very particular about my space &amp; belongings.   I have the smallest room, and due to my father’s strict rules and anger issues- it is where I spend essentially all of my time while home. It is the only space I can feel somewhat safe and actually in control of after being on my own since 17.   My mom is a genuinely kind person, always willing to go the extra mile and do the most for the people she loves- and even strangers. While I love this about her,  she does not take it well when anyone refuses her help.  There is one day a week that she has off, but I still work. She spends the day cooking/ cleaning the entire house. But for over a year now, she has ignored my requests to leave my room out of her cleaning routine. I’m more than able to do it myself, and always have cleaning planned for the following day- the first day of my weekend.   When I talk to her about it, she seems receptive. Yet, each week without fail I come home late at night to find my room rearranged, all of my belongings moved, and all of my furniture and clothes stacked up on my bed to the point where I can’t even sit down.   I get home at a time that is past my father’s approved ‘cooking/cleaning’ hours, which makes it difficult to upkeep during the week without turning the household into a World War 3 battleground. But it’s  also extremely frustrating to undo the volcano of items my mom haphazardly loads onto my bed during her weekly cleaning. This also triggers my OCD, as I feel the need to completely strip my bed and wash everything after things that were on the floor touch my previously clean sleeping space.   Every week, despite the same conversation with her, nothing changes. I’m becoming increasingly agitated every week, but also feel extreme guilt for refusing her help, when I know that she means well.  During these conversations she often breaks down and cries,   Saying how she only wants to help, which makes the guilt set in a bit more each time. But when nothing ever changes, and calm conversations don’t work, what am I supposed to do?   Am I the Asshole? Should I just let her do her thing and get used to the weekly aggravation of having to quietly reset my entire space and belongings at 10pm (hoping my father doesn’t find out I’m cleaning outside of ‘acceptable hours’) and also find money to buy even more sets of sheets than I already have in rotation so I can go to sleep feeling clean?   Sorry if this sounds crazy or stupid. but I truly feel at a loss here and just want to keep the peace while also maintaining SOME sense of autonomy over my only personal space.",

    "selftext": "Using a throwaway account because my campaign mates know my main account.   So I’ve been playing D&amp;D for about 2 years and have had a long string of player characters that have died during the campaign. I think the count is at 6 or 7. I genuinely try not to just put my character in dangerous situations, but I often feel like the rolls just don’t go my way. First one was a barbarian and I was going reckless for every attack and then the bad guy got some good rolls and just crit me a few times in a row. Then they finished me off during death saves. Then another one I decided to try being a bard, got silenced and immobilised. Then some generic low-level guys just came and beat me up and I was not able to fight back at all.  (This one was actually a little funny at how useless I was)  In any case, I know I’m not very good and will often try to strategise and my group mates always seem to be on board and then the plans just don’t pan out at all. I play for fun and don’t particularly mind being bad, but my friends have been getting progressively more upset at me and even saying things like I’m an asshole for always dying and wasting their time. I will genuinely never try to go recklessly into a situation but it feels like no matter what I do, all the aggression gets focused on me and then I get overwhelmed. I have started asking them if I should just leave the group and let them do their thing. This would be sad for me, because this was a group of close friends and I thought we were having a good time. It’s only been in the last 3-4 months that they’ve started becoming more angry towards me and i genuinely don’t know why. In any case, all input would be appreciated and there may be a perspective I’m not considering, but am I the asshole for being bad at D&amp;D?  EDIT/UPDATE: thank you everyone for your insights and support. I decided a few hours ago to reach out to the DM and just let her know I’m going to find a new group or just separate myself from this one. After a long conversation it came out that actually this group was in fact doing this on purpose and the DM was in on it. She ultimately told me because she says she felt guilty that it went so far, but this explains her lack of insight or help I guess. Apparently, this group had trouble getting through fights/encounters and the DM got frustrated that this was interfering with her storytelling. Then when I came around they found that having all the enemy attention on the new guy allowed the “real players” to explore their stories and encounters without having to retreat all the time. Honestly it seemed like some convoluted logic to me and I’m assuming they started expressing this anger towards me as a way of keeping me useless via insecurity of my experience and decisions. This inevitably made me feel like it was my fault and then when my own decisions stopped killing me, they would just allow my character to gradually die off by not equitably distributing help. In any case, I’m definitely out of this group and they definitely are not my friends. This has made me really confused because I just don’t really understand why they had to go about this in such a hurtful way. But I appreciate everyone for helping me get the courage to talk to them and push hard enough to actually get some truth.",

    "selftext": "Hi all. I'm (25M) currently recovering from a burn-out. This week I will slowly start working again, after being home for a few months. I'm able to do most activities again, but I always try to schedule a rest day after an activity. I have been pretty strict with this, because it works pretty well for now.  Today I was buying theatre tickets for me and a friend, for a show next month. When I added the tickets to my basket, I quickly messaged my parents to ask if we had any plans on that specific Sunday. The answer was no. I paid for the tickets just as my mom texted me that she would like to come to her work on that Saturday before. I told her I wasn't sure yet, because I just bought tickets for a show the day after, and the Saturday should be my rest day. Especially since Monday will be my weekly office day, which will probably be quite draining at the start. I can't really swap because the other days at the office are quite busy and the company doctor advised me to stay home those days.  My mom answered she really wanted me to come. A professional photographer apparently will be taking pictures of families that day and my mom would like me to take pictures with my sister (for my mom's 50th birthday).  What makes it even more difficult for me (and stressful and draining for that matter) is that I have a history of social anxiety and the only thing that I'm not over yet, is staged photos. I can manage spontaneous photos/selfies, but a shoot makes me incredibily uncomfortable and self-aware.  She knows I hate photos and that I need my breaks, so her asking this of me tells me this is important to her.   I'm unsure what to do now. Everyone has been telling me to put myself first right now, my mom included. She has been worried about me and thinks it's really important that I don't plan too much stuff and that I take breaks. So I guess I feel a bit annoyed, because I basically feel forced to go. On the other hand, I understand why she wants me to come. Our family is really important to her and we don't have that much photos together, so yeah.   I really don't want to hurt her by not coming. But I just feel like having a weekend without a rest day and then going to the office would be a big mistake.  Any thoughts? Thanks in advance.  Edit: many people seem to think that being in social situations, even sitting in a theatre, is free of stimuli. That's not the case, at least not for me. You can think all you want of me doubting about this but please don't downplay the effects of stimuli. If it would be draining for me to go, is not the question here.",

I told him firmly to face a different direction if he's gonna forcefully and intentionally burp that loud with our literal food ten inches away from him, smell of his previous meal out there. I have a keen sense of smell. He says with a smile and steady tone, \"my breath smells good.\" This is an ongoing issue.  I wanted to say more but it would cause a scene with so many people there.   The next evening with friends and family, he does the same thing farting really hard... In my personal space. All I've ever asked is he not do that in my personal space, three effing feet.   He looked at me irritated saying (well, voice raised loudly but not sceeamy),   *\"how about I just be brutally honest with you since nobody's gotten around to it in a while. Before you say I'm being a bitch or a bastard, maybe you should ask yourself if I was just honest and you didn't like it. Maybe it hurt your ego that nobody owes you a smile or a gentle tone when you're being disrespectful. You have a lot of nerve telling us about chronic mental illness when someone like you should be especially aware boundaries are to be respected.\"*  He went on and on trying to tell me to chill and I got angry still.  *\"Don't tell me to chill. Anger is a valid emotion it's me telling you not to get carried away with being a jackass and not being put in your place. Instead of taking this personally, take it as a constructive criticism.\"*  I wasn't screaming, I was definitely raising my voice, loud enough for all 35 people in that 70 ftx 50 ft dining room to hear.  I admit, I'm heated also because well... It's my aunt who died. Homeboy is 30.  Other cousins told me I didn't have to cause a scene. Fart loudly at a damn dinner table? Why is it hard to get up and go to the bathroom or step out of people's space?

Then she replied with “No Jordan it’s if it’s a meal worth having someone over for”  I was just thinking that it would only matter that I was spending time with her family, I didn’t think it mattered what we had to eat  I don’t understand much about relationships, my parents got divorced when I was a baby and girls didn’t talk to me until I graduated so I haven’t really seen healthy relationships before haha, so any advice would be helpful  So WIBTA or selfish if I told her that hurt my feelings?",

We live near Paris, away from any family and most of our friends because A was assigned to the local school and I worked in Paris. We are looking to move away from Paris and closer to family.   1 week after finding out she was pregnant (unexpected due to PCOS) in dec 23', I found out I was being laid off. This was a blessing and a curse as I was granted 1 year of 90% pay whilst looking for a new job. The following months I did as much as I could to help with pregnancy, wedding preparations, etc. When G was 1m, I started looking actively. I got 3 offers in march: 2 far away and 1 nearer &amp; better paid but still a 3.5h round trip. The latter also had a possibility of relocating at a later date. It was a no brainer.   For the first 3 months, I rented a studio and stayed there from Monday to Friday and came home on the weekends.  After 3 months and my trial period ended, I was granted a day of WFH and got confirmation that they would relocate me in summer of 26' (which is the earliest A can do due to public school system).  Last week I managed to negotiate an extra day of WFH meaning I could give up the studio and maybe just stay 1 night max in a hotel.   This whole time, I have been as understanding as I could be that my wife is practically living like a single mum during the week. When at home, I would try and do as many chores as possible and as much parenting as possible to give her some downtime. G is with a nanny on M-T-T-F. At home all day Wed with A.   Some things I unfortunately cannot do, like Gs medial appointments. Other's like grocery shopping, I've offered to do on the weekend but she does it during the week no matter what I say.   Every weekend I get told she's tired/depressed/can't go on like this: we need to find a solution. I'm also told it's just a bad situation with no solution and when I ask what more I can do or how I can be more present, I'm told I'm not listening.   Despite the situation supposedly getting better thx to more WFH, it's not enough. She hates me for being away so often. She has stormed out today, not to return before the end of the weekend.   Apparently I'm the only one who doesn't see how badly she's taking it and how rough she has it, when she talks about what I do (?no elaboration?) her friends/colleagues think I'm the biggest AH.  My job is the problem and it's tearing us apart.   Imo, It's our best chance at moving closer to our families (she can't relocate unless to follow me), but I need to \"stop imagining our future, the present is the problem and there won't be a future\".  We cannot afford to be on one income. I won't get any financial help from the state if I quit and my last job search was an ordeal.  Apparently, if I truly wish to provide for my family then I should pick up any low paying job next door.   I'm at a loss at what to do to fix this, talking gets us nowhere.

    "selftext": "I’d like to get some outside opinions on this, because to me, the whole thing feels like complete childishness. I’m a medical student, and one of my professors recommended me for a research project, where I was allowed to choose other person to join me. My group in college has five girls (including me), and I chose the one I’m closest to… it was already pretty clear who was closer to whom.  The thing is, my friend and I were worried about how the others might react, since this professor is very respected and admired by everyone. Honestly, I felt bad about having to choose just one, because I was afraid someone would get upset and it would create tension in the group. In the end, we took a while to tell them, about a month, mostly because we only actually started the project later, due to scheduling and timing issues.  After that, one specific person from the group started ignoring us, we’d say good morning or goodbye, and she wouldn’t even respond or make eye contact. My friend eventually asked what was going on after a few days, and they said they were all upset that we “hid” it from them, that we were being competitive, and that they always share everything. They claimed it wasn’t about not being part of the project, but about the delay in telling them.  The thing is, they don’t tell everything either. One of them was going to Chile during vacation and didn’t say a word, we only found out because another girl accidentally mentioned it in the group chat. And they have other things they didn’t share right away, which I personally think is totally normal. In my mind, there shouldn’t be this pressure to share every single little thing about our lives with everyone.  They talked about it like we had maliciously kept it a secret, when in reality, we were just trying to figure out the best way to bring it up, and we did, as soon as the project actually started. I was really hurt that they’d rather push us away than just forgive and move on. To me, this is all so childish, I honestly think if everyone had jobs and bills to pay, this wouldn’t even be a thing.

    "selftext": "AITA???  For context, my husband and I live in the US. His family is from South Africa, and because of this we don’t get to see them often. I feel for him and the sacrifices he makes living so far from them, but I struggle with the differences he and I have regarding our home and visitation.   When his brother came to the states for college, he would move in with us for months at a time between semesters. We were responsible for paying for the additional expenses of him staying with us, for example, food. It was never really asked of me if he could stay, just expected.   Fast forward to us having a baby, and MIL insisted on staying for three months once the baby was born. I fought this, as I wanted this precious time with my first child, but I lost because “in their culture, that is what grandmas do.” I was a mess the entire time and felt like I was disrespected and robbed of a precious time. It also made me resent her.   MIL now wants to come back 8 months later, and stay for a month. I told my husband this was not okay with me, and I felt like a week was more appropriate. Mind you, we cannot take off work or really change our routine. He disagreed and to compromise, we came to the decision of two weeks. Now I’m finding out she already booked her flight tickets for the entire month and won’t change them because of cost. I was told by husband’s brother, not even my husband.   We argued and he told me it’s always a fight, I make him be a bad son, and that I broke his heart because “it’s family.” I don’t hate my in-laws, but I’m extremely introverted and have an incredibly hard time with change in routine and people in my space. I can’t decompress or “turn off” when someone is living in my home. I work an incredibly stressful job on top of taking care of a baby.   AITA for fighting this fight?   Updating to add that his go-to response to my complaints is that he agreed to move in with my mother for a few weeks when she was going through a hard time and I wanted to be there for her. We stayed at her home (that is 6000 sq ft) for three weeks while we sold our house and eventually moved 15 minutes down the road so we still had our own space.   Additional edit to say my frustration primarily comes from having discussions with my husband, agreeing on something together, and that agreement not being what ultimately happens. This happens multiple times a year for several years now.",

    "title": "AITA for wanting my own room in a small 3+1 apartment",
    "selftext": "So the company my father works at has their company apartments and we have been waiting for 7 years to move in to one but they were always full. I (14M) and my two other sisters which are 15 and 17. Today we came to look into one of the houses that they were gonna give to us. 2 of us (me and the younger sister) want our own room the older one doesnt really care. Since its a 3+1, 1 room is going to our parents which leaves 2 rooms that we can stay. When we were in the house and still looking around the younger sister just claimet that one of 2 rooms was hers, and i could stay with the older one. But months ago when my dad sent us a video of the house i already told the entirebfamily that 1 room was for me and my parents even approved. Normally they love the younger sister more than anyone cuz she studies hard. But we are muslim and one of the laws says that a teen boy and a teen girl can not stay in the same room. I told her that too but she still refuses and just says that she was gonna play electric guitar (we both play it) and that it was her childhood dream (like it wasnt mine too) but idk what to say to her she is really stubborn she even tols my parents that she would cry if she never got the room. I need some advice please",

    "title": "AITA Boss didn't set clear expectations",
    "selftext": "Some brief background on the subject, I work as an apprentice/ shop hand (really it's a multi role mix of both) at a heavy duty mechanic's shop. I Genuinely hold high levels of respect for my boss and it feels he holds decent levels of respect for me. We both generally see each other favorablely and don't have much conflict.   This is where the conflict begins. I often do parts runs for the shop usually going to local parts stores and picking up the things we order and head right back. Now I get my vehicles fuel compensated for this and generally my boss(s) (him and his wife) are very generous to me with compensation often a full tank every now and then. For me who only makes $17CDN/HR it helps me out a lot and reduces my stress for fuel quite a bit. I commute a fair distance to and from work. (50km each way) Often I fill up shop Jerry cans as I'm fueling up with the shops fuel card that I have permission to use. I made one mistake in the past where I forgot to return it. My boss had forgiven me for such. Yet when I went to return the fuel card this time he was busy. So the rational side of me thought to set it somewhere visible on his tool cart. His tool cart was located in close proximity to where he was working and the way I set the fuel card back just stuck to the front and center on the outside of the lid with a magnetic bolt tray. Fully visible to the point when I was asked to find it this morning I found it exactly where I left it. The reason I didn't directly hand it to him is generally I have come to learn that when he is working on something unless it's a major issue, important information that I am relaying or asking for assistance with a task that I am working on alongside him. I didn't declare the fuel card as any of the criteria to disturb him and was satisfied seeing that the card was visible and in a spot that I assumed he would see. Yet. He didn't see, and now I'm paying the price for his lack of observation. It feels like whenever I get hit with a mistake or something that effects my standings with my bosses I get set back. I lose even more privalges I try extremely hard to gain and maintain. I arrive on time before everyone else (including my bosses) despite the commute. I keep track of my breaks and the time I am on break for. I keep myself working as much and as efficient as possible. And yet it feels that the moment I even slip up or a misunderstanding happens I'm stripped of everything I worked hard to obtain. I make sure if I do make genuine mistakes I can traceback things and explain exactly what happened down to the minute and the exact thought process, yet it just gets declared as excuses for silent expectations that I was not informed of. I don't really know. Sorry.",

    "title": "AITA for attending a class...",
    "selftext": "So this happened at my university today. We have a class for one of the secondary subjects not a major one. Two groups from different majors take this class together, so it’s not exactly the most important class. Now, the other batch couldn’t attend today because they had a major exam. They were told they’d still get attendance for it. But since my major didn’t have any exam, we wouldn’t be getting attendance unless we actually attended. I travel a long distance to get to college, so I thought, if the class is happening, why shouldn’t I attend it? Some people were saying last night that they wouldn’t come, but it wasn’t confirmed that no one would show up. When I reached the department, I saw lots of people from my major literally hiding in other departments, watching our classroom. And these were the same people who said they wouldn’t come today! When I asked why they were waiting around, they blamed two students  let’s call them A and B saying that if those two attended, the class would happen. They had even sat inside the classroom at first but ran away when they saw the professor, who’s very strict. Now, B is a serious student .. the kind who always attends class. My classmates were calling and texting her, trying to convince her not to come, even though they were standing right near the department themselves! I got completely fed up with the hypocrisy and messaged her myself, telling her to come and not listen to anyone. So A, B, and another girl went into the classroom. After seeing them, we went in too. Later, many people started blaming them, saying the class only happened because of them, and lecturing everyone about “class unity.” Funny thing is, they only remember class unity when they’re bunking! Then B told everyone that I was the one who messaged her to come ... probably to protect herself. She never even looks at my messages when I ask her academic questions, but this time she had no problem showing my message to everyone. Honestly, even if I hadn’t messaged her, she would’ve come anyway. Now people started blaming me. Some random guy I’ve never even spoken to began cursing, saying stuff like “God will punish selfish people,” and so on. Also I should not have deleted my mssg which I did cause I got scared by the situation also thinking she might have not even seen my mssg.. I’m an introvert..I keep to myself and mostly talk to just four close friends. I don’t usually get involved. But I explained everything in the class group (where I normally never text, because they talk about such random personal stuff). I even apologized, just to diffuse the situation, because I really didn’t want more drama.  So… AITA one here for messaging her to come to class?",

    "selftext": "Fiancé and I are very excited to be planning our wedding next year. I’m the oldest with two younger bros (one has a 1 year old) and youngest is my sis who has a 2 year old. Younger sis and I were very close until she had her child and didn’t pick me as godmother. I was genuinely heartbroken that she picked a friend instead but accepted it and moved on and made a mental note that I would also not dance around her any longer in life and we just wouldn’t be as close going forward. My parents and my brothers were very annoyed at the time she didn’t pick from family to be godparents and none of my brothers were picked. She said she wasn’t picking family but picked her friend (fine) and a male cousin of her boyfriends (so - she did pick family). So one two skip a few and I’m now getting married and a lot less close to my sis. Still see her but give her a wide berth. We are having my sisters child and my brothers child as flower girls + two of my friends + my sis in law as bridesmaids. I’m not asking my sis to be bridesmaid and my mum and dad have hit the roof saying how horrible I am and generally making me feel really bad about it. They said my sis knows she was wrong - but my argument is she never apologised for the way she went on around her child’s birth and how bad she made me feel (I was single at the time and living alone and not being picked felt like a kick in the teeth at what was in all honesty a pretty tough time in my life which my sis was well aware of. Anyway am I unreasonable for not asking her? My parents have been on at me  so much about not asking her and making me really feel like a horrible person for not asking and it’s starting to overshadow our own wedding plans. My sis has been with her partner 10 years and is really wanting to get engaged - since we got engaged (together 3 years) my mum and dad have continually spoke about how annoyed they are for my sister that she hasn’t got the ring yet (which is bit annoying for me!) though if it were me in her shoes I would be asking for the ring straight out 😅 thanks all for your thoughts x",

    "selftext": "What happened is, I was living in my parents old home, my sibling with his gf came back to live in the house out of the blue for a while, so they did, I tried to be of help to his gf when they only shared 1 car, only for his gf to have me wait in the parking lot for an hour in a bad neighborhood I finally said something. She didn’t like it and said “no one asked you to give me rides” I only asked her to be considerate of my time or let me know if she’s late. So back to the whole thing, my brother and her moved in and we were okay for the most part, not really close, I could tell they were avoiding me. They even took shared appliances that were my moms upstairs to their room.. When I decided to go to Christmas with my bf’s family they agreed they’d look after my pets. One week goes by I’m celebrating the holidays at my bf’s family and I get a text (I was out of state) saying they’re moving in my brothers gf’s friend and she’s already staying at the house and I would just have to deal with it. It’s a stranger to me so of course I asked my mom who owns the home to please check on our things and that I was not comfortable with the idea of living with a stranger, let alone 2 girls that hated / disliked me. My mom finally stepped back in and told my brother her old home was just for her kids and their significant others, no one else. They didn’t like that… so they packed their stuff and trashed the house, stole some of my clothes and makeup, and left my pets unattended for 5 days.. I had to ask my mom to stop by and feed them… but they demanded I apologize… my brother did end up apologizing but I was hurt and needed some time, after a month I was ready and I wanted to work my way to apologizing as well, I did not want to do it over text, for Christmas and birthdays I still tried to reach out text them and give them gifts sent to my moms, they accept the gifts but continue to ignore me and not reconcile or even see me, it’s been 4 years now and my mom never has a full family picture, everyone’s wondering why, even my moms birthdays and big life events they don’t show up. I feel guilty that I caused this and feel like I’m the a hole in this situation. My family assures me it’s not me and that they see me trying but I fear they only tell me these things because they love me. I’m hoping someone looking in can help give me their insight, I don’t want to have regrets in my life but I also don’t want to keep watering seedless dirt hoping for a sprout.

Landing on his wrist and breaking it in several places We went to the hotel doctor, cost me 600 dollars for that visit. Then the hospital (thankfully I had insurance). While there he asked me if I was upset. I was honest and said I was a little upset because this isn’t how I imagined spending our vacation and said I felt he did go a bit overboard with the alcohol. He immediately got defensive telling me he wasn’t intoxicated and the ground was slippery. I acknowledged the fact the ground could have been slippery but everyone there (The whole family) saw he was intoxicated. He got upset and started to raise his voice telling me I was playing the victim and being an ass.

    "selftext": "My roommate got us this rug that takes up a good amount of space, it’s a very cute rug. Unfortunately it gets dirty fairly quickly so about two weeks ago she said she wanted to rent this cleaning thing for the rug. I don’t know all the specifics or where to get any of that but I let her know I’d split the cost with her because we share it.   Now another thing I feel the need to mention is my roommate has a lot of stuff and doesn’t keep her side of the room very tidy. I don’t care because it’s all on her side and I’m not the most organized person either but if you saw our room you’d definitely tell there’s a difference.   We have a window sill and even though we have the room split in half she does take up majority of the window sill which again I’m fine with because she has a lot more stuff.   For about a couple days she left a bowl of half eaten ravioli on the edge of the window sill. When I was laying in bed I put something on the window sill and sort of pushed it to make sure it wouldn’t fall and I accidentally knocked the bowl over. I honestly forgot it was there because of how dark it was and it fell all over the middle of the carpet.   I cleaned it up as best as I could but obviously there is now a huge stain. When she woke up in the morning and I let her know I was really sorry and it was an accident. She said it was fine as long as I paid for the whole cleaning service now. I told her that didn’t really seem fair because it was her bowl of food she left there for days that was technically on my side of the window. I told her I would still cover half of it though.   She’s saying since I basically ruined the carpet I should pay for the entire thing. I don’t know guys, is it fair I pay for the whole thing? Should I stand my ground? I do feel really bad but I don’t have the money to pay for the whole thing but if I’m in the wrong I’ll figure it out and pay the whole thing.   EDIT: Okay quick clarification and update. Someone asked why do I live with her, she’s really not that bad and I know I didn’t make it seem that way in the post. She’s never acted that way before so honestly I was confused. Yes she is messy but I’ve shared a room with brothers, I’ve dealt with worse. And no I cannot just move out I am in a college dorm.   So after reading everyone’s replies and asking a couple other friends I realized I wasn’t in the wrong at all and it really isn’t fair if I’m forced to pay the entire thing when it wasn’t my entire fault. So I sent her a text before I went to work it was something like “Hey (her name) I really am sorry about the rug but I still don’t think it’s fair that I pay for the entire thing. Yes I am the one who knocked it over but you had left that bowl there for almost a week and it was very close to where I already put my stuff. I think it’s fair that you take some responsibility and we keep the original deal we had where we pay half and half. You can send me the receipt whenever you get the chance and I’ll zelle you my half.” (I added that last part because a friend said I should make sure I see the receipt so she doesn’t try and tell me my half is the full price). All she did was put a thumbs up reaction on the message. When I saw her later she didn’t really say anything to me. I don’t know if it’s because she was eating and watching her show or if she’s upset with me but I hope all of this will blow over.",

I have been on a \"temporary assignment\" in a very stressful position for the last 15 months, the position ends next month when I go back to my significantly less stress, less pay position.   We got the dog a year ago, mostly to increase my exercise levels and to make sure I take breaks at work by taking the dog out for walks. And I do, 1 hour morning, 20 mins at lunch, we like to walk the dog together after dinner and then one of us (50/50) will take him for a quick pee before bed.  Here is where I am may be the asshole. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping and will go to bed super early before the dogs last pee so my partner will take him. He forgets to take his harness off before bed about 25% of the time.   If I remind him to take it off before going to bed he tells me if it is so important to me, take him for a pee myself.   If I ask him if he took it off when boyfriend joins me in bed he wont tell me and makes me get up to check... if it is so important to me.  So I try not to ask as he mostly remembers.   This morning, I wake up and the dogs harness is on. I say \"oh no! the dog's harness is still on!\" He gets mad and says it is too early for me to be harping at him and refuses to speak to me. He leaves for work without saying goodbye which maybe has only happened 2x in our 13 years together.   Am I the asshole for asking about the dog's harness?  Edit: I showed my boyfriend this post and he has some things to say. The following are his unedited remarks:  I got home after work and she wasn't feeling well. I made her dinner, cleaned up, and took the dog for a walk so she could relax, watch TV and go to bed early.  The next morning I made her coffee, put the evening's dishes away, and was yelled at from across the house that I forgot to take the dog's harness off. I did forget. It is best practice. I feel bad about that. I don't feel being yelled at was warranted. AITA after all?  Addon from OP:  I did not yell (LOL)",

    "selftext": "My presentation group deliberately failed to complete the part I assigned - getting images (for the presentation slides) - and then they got irritable with me. I’m the type who dislikes micromanaging others. I simply said things like, “It would be pretty ridiculous if the presentation slides were just all text, don’t you think?” and they just stressed themselves out. At first, some people argued with me. I just found it funny how bringing emotion into work doesn’t solve the problem, only serves to decide who is “right.” So I ignored it and said the purpose directly if I wanted the conversation to continue. I would be doing boring PowerPoints forever until one guy suddenly started arguing with me in the group, I was quite amused because this was the guy I needed - he couldn't keep his cool. So I just followed the path I had drawn for him, he couldn't stand it and ended up dragging another guy out of the group. LOL.  Then a \"group leader\" came in and gave me all sorts of lectures about how they wouldn't work with me because they hated me (why should I care about other people's subjective feelings?). In the end, they decided they would make a new PP. I intentionally played the game of asking to keep the old PP, and they immediately started confirming repeatedly that they would credit me (YAHOOOOO). Even when I intentionally pleaded, as if I were genuinely sincere, that my part was too small and it was unfair to everyone else, they still insisted that I only needed to present the summary and the reinforcement questions.  If everyone asks how I feel, I just want to say I’m exhilarated. How can I not be excited when the plan was perfectly executed without a single hitch?",

    "selftext": "I’m 25M, disabled, and I have a valid disabled parking permit. I drive an older BMW, a nice one (imo).  After my physiotherapy, I walked back to my car, parked in a disabled parking spot. I got in and spent a few minutes on my phone before heading home. Just taking a short breath, i always do that after physio.  The parking lot was nearly empty. Next to me were three regular open spots, and across from me there was another empty disabled spot with two free spaces beside it. And it’s a free parking area, by the way.  Then a woman, somehere mid-60s, drives up. She stares at me for a few seconds, then parks her car half almost crisscross across the disabled spot opposite me. She gets out, walks straight up to my window, and says: “Why are you taking up a disabled spot? You’ve been sitting here playing games for fifteen minutes, and I want to park here.” Honestly, I was a bit surprised . So I said, “I’m allowed to park here. I was just doing something on my phone and was about to leave.”  Before I could even finish my sentence, she cuts me off: “You don’t need to justify yourself.” Yet she keeps going, telling me it’s rude of me to sit there and that I should move over because she “can’t park her car anywhere else, because its too long.”  She came iver a bit rude. I tried to stay polite, but I could feel the frustration creeping in. This kind of thing happens sometimes tho, someone sees a young guy in a car and immediately assumes he’s abusing a disabled spot. No one sees why that blue card is there in the first place.  Eventually, she walked away mid-sentence. And I was a bit confused. I wasn’t blocking anyone, I had a valid permit, and I was planning to leave.  So was I really being rude, or was she just frustrated?  Edit: i think i stood there for 5, maybe 6 minutes. No longer. As for my disability, i have Friedreich Ataxia. I currently walk with a walking stick, am a bit wobbly when standing, everything costs energy and my voice is a little disorted. It doesn’t get any better. When i sit i look completely ‘normal’. Not for pity, just understanding.",

I was told if I didnt go to the wedding we wouldnt be friends anymore, and I didnt like the ultimatum. We havent spoken since. Am I the asshole? I am a cis straight male, if that makes any difference.

    "selftext": "My wife and I have been married for 15 years, both in our late 30s. We accumulated a large amount of consumer debt (about $50K) over the last few years on a variety of things.   One of our cars is 15 years old and needs a new engine so we have to buy something newer to replace it.  I make good money at my job and have been working to pay off all the debt slowly but surely and I’m about 30% of the way there. I hope to be completely done by the end of next year.  When we start looking at cars I told my wife the budget and she seemed unhappy with the options in that price range (roughly $15K). I explained to her that it was only temporary and we just needed to keep this next car for a couple of years while we finished paying off some of this debt and I didn’t want to take on another large loan at this point.  Well she then goes to her mom and dad and tells them that we can’t afford anything, or words to that effect and that we don’t have any money.    So they come in and tell her they will give us some money to help with the purchase. I told my wife that I didn’t want their money, that we are almost 40 years old and we just need to work through this on our own without taking her mom and dad’s money. I also didn’t want to feel like I owed them something even if I technically didn’t.   Well that plea fell on deaf ears. Last night she told me that they are helping anyway and are going to give us $25K towards the purchase of a car. Of course they have to approve what we buy or no money.   I’m pretty upset by this. We are a fully functioning adult family with children. I have financially supported us for years on mostly my income and I have the means to continue doing so. Yes, our financial situation from a savings perspective isn’t the greatest but the cash flow is there to afford a minimal car payment while still paying chunks of debt in order to help us moving forward.   I feel like my wife went behind my back and did this and it feels disrespectful to me as her husband that she would involve her parents to this extent by pleading poverty to them.   AITA for being upset with her in this situation?",

    "selftext": "I (21F) attend university. I once had a conversation with a friend where we talked about how we don't understand people who willingly attend university and then spend every second of their time hating on it. They post about it on their socials, repost every tiktok and reel talking about hating uni and even in school or outside of school they talk about how much they hate going to school, attending lectures and doing schoolwork. And most people who I know who do this have no problem of getting out of this situation or in other words leaving uni.  I have a finsta, it's a group of 20 of my closest friends. One morning when i was thinking back to the conversation with my friend I thought about a picture that would describe these people perfectly. So i posted 30 second rant (I post rants about different kind of stuff on my finsta often, it's a good way to let out thoughts inside my head) talking about how I don't get these people (never once did i say i hate them). I mentioned everything i mentioned higher in my rant and then posted a picture of that bird behind two bars (just search bird behind bars meme) with the caption 'people attending uni who spend every second of their free time hating on university'.  Few hours later some friends from high school texted me that I should think before I post something like that, because I never know people's situation. I explained to them that I meant people who are in that situation willingly and still hate on it. They spent the next half an hour saying they don't care who I meant, that it can be hurtful and offensive and I shouldn't be putting it on the internet, and that they don't care that I only have 20 of my closest friends on my finsta, because it can still hurt someone and much much more.  See the thing is these friends are lowkey the ones hating on uni. One of them is in a degree she doesn't like and the other is studying medicine. And even though I explained to them that it wasn't targeted towards them they still insisted that it was inappropriate. In all seriousness I never even once thought of them talking about it. So, am I the asshole?  edit: i've apologized to them, offered to take the post down but they said they don't want that, they just want me to \"come to my senses next time i want to post shit like that\" and to set the record straight they have talked to me more in this one conversation criticising me than in the past year when i tried to talk to them and ask how they're doing, so i genuinely didn't have any idea how their studies are going because every time i would try to make conversation with them they'd reply with one word answers like ok, yeah, lol, great.

Ellie and I both agree that we don't like him, and we haven't hidden this from Lisa. We've brought up our concerns with her a few times.

I’m not the type of person to beg someone to talk to me so I didn’t message back until Thursday when he randomly messaged me like nothing happened. We were talking like normal and to get to the point, we somehow started arguing again and he suddenly starts telling me how I’m not being supportive enough of his feelings, how I should know that I shouldn’t be teasing him etc and I told him how was I supposed to know if he didn’t tell me how he was feeling and that that’s what he needed? He got so angry and told me that I should know automatically and that I’m the only person out of all the people that he’s told about his feelings, that’s acted like this and I asked him what am I acting like and he just left me on read once again.

And also my mom says I was wrong for that and is mad at me, so yea I think I did go too far.   I’m 15f and my sister is 23f.  It always starts the same , my mom brings up that I’m not eating enough, saying stuff infront of her like “she only ate cereal since this morning,” and that’s when my sister jumps in. She starts yelling, shaming me, and literally bullying me too, and trying to punish me literally. Then it’s two against one. And I’d be wrong for not mentioning this so , I get that she worries since I had anorexia when I was 12, but wheather or not it doesn’t dismiss that she goes too far and is unnecessary. She jokes,  forces me to eat, and convinces my mom to make rules about it , even though I’m not underweight. I’m just skinny.  During this last argument, she said “ yea she should eat so her boobs can come in” and that I look like a little boy. So since, She recently got lipo cosmetics for her body, and talks ahd is actually considering about getting ribs removed for a smaller waist, so I said “Its sad you have to alter your body for the sake of beauty”  She said and brought up that she wanted surgery since middle school because of bratz dolls, and I said “Those dolls bodies were literally made by men. Beauty standards are shaped by men, so you’re doing it for male validation. What else is an ass for besides sitting and shitting?”  She kept saying things like how I’ll stay in a little kid’s body forever and even compared me to our younger cousin and said she has more boobs and body than me, which is honestly disgusting... yikes…So I said “women who get their bodies done have nothing else to offer” I know that was harsh…I said it because I was angry ,but part of me still feels it’s sad how many women feel shaped by that idea. Like I get hair dye/cuts, trends,style, makeup, but full on surgery’s? Wheather or not the risks are significant or little, it’s too far… but then again, it’s their life,and I said it because I was mad not everyone individually so ..  After that, she went to shower and went to her room and hasn’t talked since. My mom says I was rude and need to respect her and is really mad at me, even when I sit there and never say anything when their literally bullying me and shaming me literally 2 against one like their kids, when their not. I know i knowI shouldnt have said all that I said, but she crosses the line too.  Did I go too far? do you think my words actually hurt",

For the background, they are disabled and unable to work. I've provided for them financially for the majority of their adult life and they cannot pay for their housing. I do not mess with people's housing so when we broke up I assured them that I'd continue to pay the full mortgage, the majority of the bills, and continue to send them money when they can't cover our electricity.   Now for my actual question about if I'm the asshole. I breed snakes, and have far longer than we were together. When we were together they wanted to be a part of the snakes so we said that we were partners with the snakes and we had dreams of turning them into a real incorporated business. That never happened though. Since they cannot work I put in all the money for the snakes and personally bought all of them and all of their supplies. Last week my ex sprung it on me that they would like to have the money from selling over half of the snakes and be done with the snakes. I was shocked that they'd ask for that since I paid for everything and since they're the one leaving. They're acting like we owned a fully incorporated business and that their entitled to half+ of the assets. My thoughts are that it was my hobby before we were even together, they inserted themselves into the snakes, I bought and paid for everything out of my personal money, any profit the snakes have made has gone into and will continue to go into payment of our housing, and that the money from selling half the snakes isn't actually profit but rather it's for the supplies for the snakes themselves. Am I the asshole for refusing to give them the money from selling over half the snakes? They did contribute to the snakes in some positive ways and I want to make sure that they feel appreciated for that. However, they are acting entitled to money that isn't even available for anyone to have since it's for supplies and it feels wrong since I paid for all the snakes personally, and that I continue to financially support them.",

    "selftext": "I have a sister who is a collegiate runner(cross country and track). I am currently in school for graphic design and also love doing photography on the side. This past year I decided to volunteer to take photos for the running program as the school doesn't provide much media coverage. I have a photography business on the side. My sister started 'talking to' one of the male members (we will call him Todd) of the team. I would say I have good intuition, and from the start I had a horrible feeling about this man plus he's kinda ugly (inside and out LOL) but anyway... Since I can be very petty I had planned not to take any photos of this man at all for the meets I'd attend, but my sister had practically begged me to take these photos for him. I ended up taking photos for him and everyone else on the team, editing them, then sending them all a link to the folder.     As many straight men in sports do, most of the males changed their profile photos, including Todd, which I'll say I do not mind at all and actually it boosts my ego a tad because that means people like my work. Anyway, it has been over a year since I had taken these initial photos, since then he has posted the photos I have taken at LEAST 50 TIMES. I do have a social media page for my photography to gain business and get exposure, yet this man has not tagged me once. He has posted these on his main insta and a majority of the time he posts them on his insta story with some cringy rap song. After I saw one of the very first posts he made on social media using my photos, I approached him and told him that I have a photography instagram and would appreciate it if he tagged me in the future. Mind you I did this just as like a \"hey I have this insta and I'd appreciate it if you could tag me next time\" all respectful and all. Well he did not listen and continued to post the same photos over and over to this cringy songs with not tagging me once. This made me mad, I approached him kindly and was left with basically silence.    I decided to put my photography watermark on all my photos for the following season. Since nobody else was being blatantly rude I put my watermark in the bottom corner so if someone wanted to crop it out they could, or some just contacted me and I gave them the photos as they are respectful.   Running sports are mostly individual so all the photos I gave Todd were just him and had my watermark right next to his head so he can not avoid it. I was honestly so proud of myself and then I hear a little birdie tell me that he is now going around telling people Im a bad photographer. I told one of my friends about the situation and she said the issue laid in both of our laps, so now I am here to ask. Maybe it is just my own personal bias but I just don't see why he cannot tag my business when I am giving these photos for free, and now he is trying to influence my business.   Anyway, AITA????",

My wife thinks we should send her back to avoid drama but I think it should be Olivia’s choice. AITA for refusing to send her back after she found out her mom lied to her?",

I captioned it with “please just eat it all next time this is very disappointing”. After I sent this text she reply’s “sorry” then doesn’t speak to me for days.

    "title": "AITA for \"infantilizing\" my roommate?",
    "selftext": "Hi all, I (24M) have been having an increasingly grating time with my roommate (26M) and his habits regarding to shared chores &amp; food resources.  Since we've moved in, I was trying to get him to eat better &amp; learn how to cook [ETA: He requested this help. I didn't force this randomly]. He's a self proclaimed vegetarian, has autism related texture issues, &amp; refuses to eat certain staple foods because it reminds him of bad stuff. I'm not mad at that, I've hand picked recipes working around those restrictions. I've showed him \\~8 times now how to do the same recipe, then written it physically, digitally and even offered to record a video of me making it. Something simple, &amp; quick for something that would feed him for days. He hasn't attempted once. Even stuff I've pre-cut for him to cook with ends up just being shoved to back of the fridge for me to find molded over when I'm cleaning. I gave up.  Now, though, he goes through entire sleeves of bread in less than 30 hours with nothing more than PB on it, eats entire boxes of crackers and cereal, family sized packages of oatmeal, sometimes even all the fresh fruit we buy. Usually in such short time spans it feels like I can't enjoy anything without feeling some sort of rush to get there first. (We buy groceries with pooled together money) It wouldn't be so grating if he just would take the time out of his day to replace the things he eats up when he's the one with more free time.   He's even done it to things that are expressly mine &amp; he's done it to my baking. The first time I made milk bread I had just pulled the two loaves out from the oven to rest overnight to enjoy in the morning. By the time I woke up there was maybe 3 slices left of one loaf. I'm not sure how he didn't get sick. I'm not, like, fat shaming him either. He's rail thin - I'm the fat one. Ive told him often he needs to eat REAL meals so he isn't constantly going back into the kitchen every 30 minutes still hungry. Spoken from experience.  But once he finally DOES cook something proper to eat, he leaves a MESS. The inside of our cabinets are stained with soy sauce and sticky honey. I've had to get uncooked rice out of my flour, sugar, and my dog's water bowl. He doesn't clean after himself. I could leave it like that for days and he wouldn't care or notice. He also routinely dumps rice \\*into the sink\\* and not the garbage. I remind him constantly, near daily, to PLEASE stop that. I can even count how many times he's done the dishes on one hand since the beginning of this year. His reasoning is that he just doesn't like how it feels, or he just didn't think about it. He won't even take out the garbage or clean his cats litter until it I ask him to or remind him, or it gets so bad he \\*has\\* to.  I've already talked to my roommate about why I'm upset with him and his only response was sort of like \"I will try to remember to do XYZ\" (not even a hardline \"I will do better\") and \"I know you care about me but you don't need to infantilize me\".  That's been bothering me. AITA?",

The other two let’s call them “Hallie” and “Jenna” do not like me or Lilly what so ever. It all started when we moved in together, we r all freshmen in college, and everything was cool. After a few weeks Jenna would invite her bf over and he’d stay for multiple days without asking us if it was okay. There was one time her bf walked in on me changing twice and I told her he made be uncomfortable and she didn’t do anything. Jenna would also drink a lot and would constantly ask us to babysit her when she was drunk. One time she walked into incoming traffic at a fb game drunk asf and we literally had to carry her back to the dorm. Hallie and Jenna start shitting on me and Lilly for not being like them (drinking all the time and smoking a lot). There’s a bunch of issues we all have with each other that makes it hard to live together. Jenna sleeps with the light on, is otp w her bf all the time, goes to bed at 3am, the list goes on. Me and Lilly tried to have a conversation about our concerns for Jenna and our boundaries w everything, but they did not want to do any of that. They basically don’t respect me or Lilly. A few weeks ago Jenna tells me and Lilly she has an extension on Canvas that tells her all of the correct answers before submitting an exam/quiz/assignment. Me and Lilly think it’s totally unfair, especially bc the class we all have together is kinda challenging. We decided to tell our professor and she said she’d talk to Jenna the next time we have class which is next Tuesday. I know for a fact she will get in trouble and it will be on her record, but idk if what we did was the right thing.

    "selftext": "I (27F) and my bf (26M) have been in a back and forth argument on who has the right stance on this, so here I am. In March 2025, I found out that I received a lottery acceptance into the NYC Marathon for November 2025. There was a 2% acceptance rate and I was really excited but really nervous. My bf and I had been dating 4-5 months at this time, but have had intentions on this being a serious relationship from the get go, so we moved forward with booking this trip to NYC (we are traveling from Chicago). We are going to be sharing a hotel room with my parents who are flying in from FL to see me in the marathon. My best friend from college is also flying into NYC for this event as well.   Flash forward to now, 17 days from the NYC marathon. My bf gets invited to a Halloween party in NYC by one of his coworkers that also lives in Chicago, but will be in NYC the same weekend we will be. I made it abundantly clear that I will not be attending parties or going out because of the upcoming marathon. I decline the invite, but he asks if my friend coming would want to go, or he could just go by himself. I’m starting to get upset by this because I have been training for this marathon for the last 21 weeks, putting a lot of effort into creating an itinerary of places for us and my family to go while we are in NYC. While technically we don’t have plans after our 7 PM Broadway show, he is expecting to still make it to his coworker’s Halloween party afterwards. He says it’s not that big of a deal since we don’t have anything planned in the evening (so technically there is free time after the show).  Further backstory - I am not trying to be this crazy gf that says he cannot go out with his friends or coworkers. His coworker lives in Chicago with us, and he could make plans to see any of his friends at any point in time. I have zero problem with that. This is also his female coworker that I have not met or crossed paths with since we have been dating for 11 months now. I know literally nothing about her besides her first name.  I am selfishly making a big deal out of this trip because I am running in the marathon in NYC and it’s the whole point of this trip. Plus I don’t know how to explain to my parents why my bf left our hotel room to go see his coworker and other strangers I have never met before. I think that paints a terrible picture and I feel like he is not acting like a supportive bf.  He says he won’t be going but I think he’s just saying that because he knows how I feel about it now, instead of making me, his gf a priority in this trip. Idk.   Am I the asshole for feeling upset about this?",

    "selftext": "Hello, I am 18 and graduated high school, I have a full time job but still live with my mom and don’t pay any bills except my phone bill. I’ve been working for the past few months, close to a year. My mom and I used to be very poor id say, there were times when she had to borrow money just to buy me ice cream. It’s way better now, I lend her money very rarely as she never really asks anymore. Life is better. But I only have her, no dad so obviously we have less money than families with both working parents and my mom is a waitress so yeah. I have the whole paycheck to myself, it’s not a very good job but it’s really a lot of money when u have no bills to pay for. I’m almost ashamed to admit this, but i’ve been buying myself nice things. Before I got a job, i’d go shopping like once/twice a year for school, I was always too shy to ask my mom for money for clothes when I knew there were more important matters. Now, I buy myself clothes more often, all of them are second hand because i don’t wanna waste money for brand new ones. I even upgraded my phone, from some cheap samsung to iphone 16. And my new ipad just arrived, i’ve never even had one before. I was so happy, until I started feeling so quilty.. I never had such expensive things before, let alone my mom. It might seem ridiculous, but one time she sent me a picture of some juices at a shop. The quality was so bad it made me cry, because she has such cheap things, that was some time ago and now she has a better phone yet it haunts me. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t spend all mh money all the time, i’ve saved up 10k for a car (in my country’s currency) as i’m in the process of getting my license. But i’m so so sad. I’m ashamed. So ashamed that even though i’ve had this phone for like half a year, my mom has no idea. Whenever she’s around I don’t use it, just hide it because I don’t want to admit how expensive it was. I’ll probably do the same with my ipad. My best friend told me it’s my own hard earned money, that it’s okay I spend it on myself yet I feel quilty. Ik even now, my mom wouldn’t be able to afford these things. She can afford bills, food, everyday life but not a new ipad or phone just like that. I keep telling myself it’s okay, that I can treat myself now because once I move out I’ll probably never be able to get such luxuries. It’s not about the money alone, it’s just the fact I spend it on myself. I thought well maybe after I get my car, pay for the insurance etc I’ll give my mom some money to treat herself, but I hate to admit i’m so selfish with money.. If someone owes me even 2$ I’ll remember. I hate my relationship with money, as ridiculous as that sounds. I’m so afraid of being broke, so ashamed of spending large amounts on myself. So quilty whenever I buy anything. So selfish when I have to spend it on someone. This post is so long and i’ve just been jumping onto different subjects, but I hope you get the point. And please let me know if I really am the asshole.  Update: Thank you for all your comments, you’re right about me being TA. Our bills aren’t as expensive because we got our apartment from the government so I believe my mom just pays for things such as water etc, so I think ill start giving her some of my money and she can spend it however she wants. After all everything I have is thanks to her. I really feel ashamed after reading the comments because I felt bad, but I didn’t realise just how selfish I was being. And i’m sorry for my english, it’s not my first language.",

Well, one day she asked me, i think a few months before, if it wanted to leave with her to move into an online friend of hers in Maine because she no longer wished to stay with my dad. I only said yes because i was scared of what would happen if i said no, either guilt tripping or manipulation, yelling, what have you. everyone left on a trip, and i wanted to stay home because i just wanted to be alone, but my mother decided to stay as well. turns out that was a perfect time to leave, my mother wrote a note and everything. we stayed at one of her friends places for a while, until her online friend showed up in a while van with no windows with her boss and his wife i think. the van was hot, and the boss slept completely nude in the back with a minor inside. i only knew this because i accidentally saw his whole ass sticking out from the blanket. was lucky i didnt see anything else.      we get to maine and we stay for a few days in the friends house until apparently my dad and mom talked things over and wanted to give it another try. he and my aunt were coming up to maine to pick us up, and meanwhile we stayed with my grandma who was nearby ish. online friend and her boyfriend were obviously mad at my mother for this but knew i was not at fault, thankfully. even got a few anime cd's as a gift. grandma ended up coming with us to where we live now, apparently not wanting to stay with her partner anymore either or something, not sure of the extent.   we get home and not even a few weeks later theres another note from her and she's gone. a few days before halloween no less. brother and i didnt particpate that year but dad got us some candy at least to try and cheer us up. she's tried getting us to talk to her, and i was willing beforehand, but eventually i tapped out and no longer wished to speak with her. she never really put in effort to contact us or see us, not even a text. i would get comments how \"she's your mother, give her a chance.\" from my own aunt no less, but also my mothers boyfriend would say so too. dad never did, i think mainly due to the fact she cheated on him shortly before the whole fiasco. I don't have to worry about those comments nowadays due to recent stuff with her but was i the asshole for not wanting to give her a chance before that?",

    "selftext": "My girlfriend and I moved in together in July (she owns a house that I moved into). We pretty rarely fought before moving in together, but since then, conflicts are becoming more frequent.    I'll spare the list of examples, but it came to a head today. We both work, and I often return home first. We had some landscapers coming by to trim a tree that was hanging in the road; they were supposed to come by early in the morning but didn't show up by the time we left. However, my girlfriend had already sent them pictures of what we needed done and agreed on a price over text, so we went to work and figured it would get done at some point.    I got back first, and I saw their truck was here and they were still trimming branches in the right spot. I had gone to the grocery store on the way home so I got the groceries out and put them up in the fridge. Right as I sat down at my desk, my girlfriend texted asking if I could check on the workers. I got up right away and went outside, and their truck was gone with the trimming done, so I let her know. About 6-7 minutes had passed since I walked in.    She called me and told me that the landscaper was asking for $300 more than we agreed on beforehand, because they ended up trimming a different part of the tree that was near a neighbor's fence. We did not ask them to do this and had not agreed to pay more.    However, within moments of telling me this my girlfriend said \"Did you check on them when you got home?\" I told her I did, that they were there when I first pulled up but left about 5 minutes later, after I put away the groceries. She said \"Next time, make checking on the people working on the house a priority. The groceries can wait.\"    I told her that that wasn't fair, and that this overcharge issue was on them, not me; they did work beyond what we agreed on and were trying to take advantage of us. And she told me that she doesn't blame me, but wants to make sure that next time I handle it differently so this can be avoided.   This seemed very unfair to me, and in the setting of many prior criticisms and comments, we got into a huge fight. She kept saying that she doesn't blame me for this incident, but that if someone is working on your house, you should check on them right away/frequently. I agree with that if someone is working \\*inside\\* your house, but for trimming a tree outside? I even verified by sight when I first pulled up that they were working on the right spot (they were) at that time.    She told me that I take every suggestion and feedback personally and get offended, and she doesn't know how to communicate with me about issues if I can't handle solutions to problems; I feel like I'm getting called/made to feel guilty for not handling the situation exactly how she would have. I'm not even sure that me checking on them before they left would have actually made a difference.     AITA?",

    "selftext": "Throwaway because they follow my main account.  For some context, while growing up my mother would always insist that something was wrong with me mentally growing up. This spanned from when I was about 8 until I was 17. Most of my childhood was spent seeing different therapists, doctors and psychiatrists. She did turn out to be right that there was something (I was formally diagnosed with OCD and ADHD at different points and I was screened for autism twice but it was determined I am not autistic), but because of this, I’m extremely uncomfortable with people even joking about my mental health or things I may or may not have.  I’m in a friend group of 4 other people and it’s not something that’s ever been an issue. One of them knows about my childhood and mother as one of them grew up with me.  Lately one of them, Lia, has been on a kick of saying everyone is autistic. “Your ‘tism is showing” or “That’s just part of being autistic”. The others don’t mind those jokes directed at them which is fine. That doesn’t bother me at all. But yesterday we went to lunch and I took pickles off of my sandwich and another friend joked that I was being too picky. But Lia chimed in with “that’s just because he’s autistic.” When I asked her to please not call me autistic she asked “Why? It’s not like I’m wrong.” I told her I’m uncomfortable with people assuming about my mental health and she just told me I’m “disgusting for acting like being called autistic is an insult.”  My one friend is saying I was right to set a boundary but I’ve been getting texts from the other two asking me to just apologize, so I want an outside perspective to see if I really am an AH for asking her not to call me autistic.",

I had my permit a few times I begged my grandma to teach me she says i look uncomfortable behind the wheel so she said she wouldn't help me any longer. -- my dad isn't around and my mom lives an hour away from me , i don't have any one else who will teach me -- Either way it worked whatever she drives me 40 minutes to my college everyday, her fault right? Anyways I beg to be able to drive but besides the point, she also helped pay my tuition because it was expensive and I could not stay in nursing school and work enough to pay the $900 a month. This year my boyfriend (18M) came to live with us this was under a few rules; he would help pay for my tuition instead of paying rent, he would work, etc. Okay, and he has his license but no car. My grandma said we could fix up this car we have that has some issues and we agreed everything great; well my grandma was late on her car payment so she told us if we payed her $500 car payment we could just use her car well guess what? we gave her the $500 and she lied. she never let us use her car and then we didn't have the money to fix the car. So she drives us to college everyday and this year days are longer; now she's demanding money for gas and for her \"pain and suffering\" even though she kind of did this to herself and we do give her gas money but she wants even more, but the whole point is she doesn't HAVE to drive us... I feel like she did this to herself, either way now she wants $200 a week or every other week and I really don't have the money for it, we both need to have time to study our schooling is hard and the payments are 1k a month... anyways AITA?",

    "title": "AITA For Spreading A Rumor I Didn't Know Was False?",
    "selftext": "So I majorly screwed up.  A year ago, I had depression (I'm on meds now), and basically addicted to my phone.  As a result, instead of actually socializing with my friends, I would often talk if spoken to and make jokes, but mainly be focused on my phone the entire time.  My friends staged around 2-3 interventions that failed before I started actually going to therapy, getting diagnosed, and taking meds.  By around the end of the school year, I was working towards getting off my phone, and I'm phone free now.  I haven't told them any of this.  As a result, two of my friends from the group, A &amp; B, were pissed because I essentially hadn't talked that much to them last year.  The problem is, they're the people that our group kind of 'orbits' around, if you get what I mean.  This year they were cold towards me but it was manageable and we still talked, especially if there were other people.  We had club tryouts this year, and I was pretty confident I was going to get into the best team since I was in that team before. The problem comes from when one of my friends, someone I'll call friend C, told me that one of our friends told him that friend A said I was 100% in the best team.  Friend C's a very honest person, so I believed them, especially since it lined up with what I'd been told, like an idiot.  When the results came however, I was confused since I was on second best team.  I was kind of upset, so to some people, I'd essentially told them \"I don't get why I wasn't on (the best team), I heard that friend A said I got one of the highest scores on the test\" (since certainly being in the best team = one of the highest scores in my eyes), which I shouldn't have done.  So this got around to her, and she was mad (obviously), so I tried to explain the whole thing, apologized repeatedly, and promised to tell everyone what happened.  She's been completely ignoring me for a week now, which is deserved, but she and Friend B also started telling our entire friend group I was purposely spreading rumors to ruin her reputation.  At first I thought maybe she didn't understand, so I asked friend C(who apparently didn't know it was false either) if he could vouch for me, and he did.  She said that I had still lied, and that I was a fake friend, crazy, and that everyone hates me, even though most of the group had been completely fine with me before she started spreading the rumors.  Now, my entire friend group thinks I completely lied on purpose and kicked me out of everything.  I had to send actual screenshots because people didn't believe me at least 3 times now, and I really don't know how to fix this.  There's more to this, so I can answer any questions since this is kind of confusing.",

    "title": "AITA for acting weirdly after my boyfriend's family saw me naked",
    "selftext": "A day ago, I(18 F) was at my long-term boyfriend's(19 M) place as per usual. We were having a nice time, just hanging out in his room, nothing out of the ordinary. We decided to grab dinner soon as it was getting late. I had to pee. So I went to his toilet which is in front of his room to do my business. I got in, locked the door, and sat down on the toilet seat and started to pee.    However, his door has this weird issue with it where even after turning the thing that locks it, you have to open and close it for it to stay locked. Apparently I did not do this, nor did i check. Which I usually do every single time I use his toilet.      As I was peeing and using my phone, the door swung open. His little brother looked straight at me, and so did his dad behind him. I shut the door immediately. The nightmare did not end there. From inside the toilet I heard his little brother telling the whole family, \"(My boyfriend\"s name)'s friend is pooping!\"  and a lot more, along with the laughter of my boyfriend and other family members. My boyfriend lives in a household of 6. I just sat there in the toilet even though i was already done with my business, dissociating for a few minutes and listening to the chatter outside die down.   When I got out, I ran straight into his room and apparently he did not think it was a big deal and did not try to comfort me whatsoever. I said I did not want to eat dinner anymore and lied on his bed until it was late enough for the rest of his family to vacate the living room so I could leave his house without bumping into any of them. I told my boyfriend to not walk me home as I was feeling a bunch of emotions I did not understand myself.  He messaged me later on asking about my weird behaviour and if something was wrong. I ignored all of them and his calls as I was and still am too embarrassed to talk to him about it and went to bed. The next day when I finally texted him back, he was upset and mad at me as I made him spiral all night and made him unable to sleep when I ignored him. He told me I shouldn't feel embarrassed as every member of his family has been walked in on before which made me feel even worse. I don't think that logic applies here as I still see myself as an outsider around his family and it feels like he is downplaying how I feel.  We are on bad terms now and I don't know what to do. I feel angry, but not at anyone in particular. I am very insecure about my body, and this incident has really left me with a constant sinking feeling. The fact that my boyfriend did not try to comfort makes me feel even worse too. I was already feeling awkward around his family, and after this I don't think I can even look any of them in the eye. But I don't think I am in the wrong for acting the way I did. AITA?",

    "title": "AITA if I drop off a note and baked goods to my neighbor who made me pick up somebody else’s dog poop?",
    "selftext": "My SO (M33) and I (F32) moved into a new area. I’m careful about my dog going potty on lawns, I ALWAYS pick it up and bring extra bags. Tonight on our walk, our dog went potty immediately. Picked it up and looped around back towards our house from the other direction. Close to home he sniffed another dogs poo and we kept going.   We’re at our door when I hear somebody running up behind startling us. A guy is coming at us with “Your dog pooped on my lawn and you need to pick it up”. I say calmly, “I know for a fact that didn’t happen, you’ve got the wrong dog”. He insists it JUST HAPPENED, he saw it, and has it on camera. I say, “Let’s see the footage because I’m POSITIVE”. My SO didn’t want it to escalate so he says, “Let’s go take a look”. Neighbor puts his hand on my SO’s back and pushes him towards his house. They are of similar cultural background so maybe ok but I didn't like it. I look down and see I have our bag in my hand and yell ahead to them. They didn’t hear me or my SO didn’t want me to get involved. I take a breath, drop off the dog, and head back. If by some miracle my dog had gone without me noticing I would apologize and pick it up.   Neighbor shows me over to where it is and points to the poo in question, I shine my light and I can’t help but literally start laughing out loud. Every oz of diplomacy failed at that moment. It was white, dry, hard as a rock, and TINY. Obviously been sitting there for a long time and where I saw my dog smelling it. I said incredulously, *“*That’s not my dog’s poop, can’t you see how hard it is? It’s old”. He answers, “I’m not here to argue with you-just pick it up.” Now, I’m pissed. I know my SO hates when I argue with people, but I have a strong respect complex. I look this man dead in the face as I scoop it up and say, “Funny how you don’t want to ‘argue’ but you want to make me pick up somebody else’s DOG SHIT. Where’s the camera footage? Would love to see it”. Then my SO hurries me away towards home.  He tells me we should be the bigger people and reminds me there’s so many bigger things in life. Says he also laughed, told him it was super old and also made it clear we didn’t do it. Told him “you must be having a hard time with this issue if you’re having to literally run after people. I’m sorry this happens to you so much”. SO doesn’t let things like that get to him and always feels bad for the out of line person. I often feel the need to correct them. In the grand scheme of things it’s just a piece of poo. But the principle is what gets me. Now here’s where I might be an ahole: I’m considering baking him treats and dropping them with a note like “I’m the bigger person we got off on the wrong foot but you’re still totally wrong and I’m not the one”. My SO thinks it isn’t necessary, and we should ignore him. I’m not trying to start anything bigger but I’m also not a doormat.

    "title": "AITA: I accidentally bad-mouthed one of the other clubs and the coach overheard me.",
    "selftext": "Context: I have been training waterpolo for about a year, and where i am there are 4 major clubs that do not represent the country. For the sake of privacy i will reference them as club 1,2,3 and 4 and they are not ranked based on skill or anything like that. Im not the best by any means, infact i think of myself as the worst one there, but i have experience playing for all of them other than club 1.  Now onto the story. So finnaly after one year of being the newest member of club 2, someone else decided to join. This got me excited, and after practice was over i went over to him and decided to be a good teammate and talk to him so he feels welcomed into the club. We met in the lobby after we got dressed from practice and talked a decent bit. I decided to tell him how i got my first golden medal. I told him that even though i play for club 2, on the yearly/grand tournament my coach decided to let the other teams borrow me for 2 reasons: i was the newest one there, being the least of value; and the other clubs where missing players. To be specific, team 3 which was a mixed club (men and women) was missing a goalkeeper, and also the rest of the club wasn't that sharp either as i was faster than all of them during warmups, and team 4 which litteraly had HALF of their players borrowed from either club 1 or 2. Due to these reasons i told him that here there are basically 2 good clubs, club 1 and 2, and that the others suck. (Now even though i barely played for my team, i still won gold because my team won gold, but i dont think this is relevant to the story)  Well as it turns out the coach for team 4 happened to be in the lobby, and when he heard what i said he got defensive and told us that thier club will be good, and that i was playing against thier underaged players.  I feel bad that he heard that, and of course no body wants to hear bas stuff about themselves or something they've poured time into and also because i played for them in the tournament, but i feel like what i said was only the truth as yes, they do suck in comparison to club 1 and 2, while also furhter proving my point as due to the fact that they needed to borrow players in the first olace meant they weren't good enough to compete in the first olace. Also i think that i said nothing wrong - only the trith that happens to be cold and harsh. It wasnt directed as an insult, but only the truth so the new teammate could get a better understanding of the competition.  So am i the asshole?",

    "selftext": "I’m 20 years old and my mom has been an addict for as long as i can remember. When i turned 18 she lost 1000 dollars a month from her social security so it was a big change. I finally have a part time job and make about 400 dollars each check (give or take bcz i don’t have a set amount of hours.) My mom is demanding half of every check and i don’t want to give it to her as she is an opioid addict. And quite frankly has never been good with money. She already spends my 160 that i get on my food card every month by ordering name brand groceries and so much meat and fruit that goes to waste.   On top of that my friend who lives with us also pays her rent. My mom never asked for me to pay rent until 1. she got her other pain meds cut off and 2. when my friend moved in and started paying her rent.   My mom also went bankrupt for the second time a few months ago. She is already talking about getting a loan for a car while her license is also suspended. I don’t feel comfy paying a drug addict that i know very well half of my pay check.   I get that she is in pain and has back issues and surgeries coming up and  she really does want to get clean but im tired of seeing no progress and trusting her word. Not even two days latter my friend gave her 400 she was coming to me saying she had no money for cigs or umo fare.   She gets mad when i talk about moving and saying why would i want to pay rent somewhere else and it’s gonna be more. I know it will be more but giving the living situation i am in current, it’s not worth a dime.   On top of it all i found out that i am pregnant so i really can’t be living here and like this nor am i gonna be giving her money that i will need more than ever to someone who doesn’t know how to budget and is just gonna spend it on drugs. Every morning day and night i have to check on her making sure shes not folded like a lawn chair. I can’t take care of a kid and her.   Edit: In no way do I plan on staying here for very long especially if she doesn’t start taking big steps very soon. My bf really wants to be here for me and step up and get better job so we can get our own place. I am gonna ask my boss to move up to full time so I can better prepare for my next steps aswell. I know i am not responsible but I never needed to be before and I am gonna do everything I can to make this life worth living for me and my kid.   And tbh all i am seeing in the comments is stuff that i am fundamentally aware of, so it’s more so just solidifying stuff i already know and will need to do. So everyone telling me this is a bad situation and that i am irresponsible. I KNOW THAT, that is why things need to change and I want to change them FAST.   At this point it’s not even about the rent money or if i am the asshole. i just wanted to hear everything i already know so i don’t feel like im just abandoning her for no reason. It’s so unfair that i am the one that was left with this, so proud of my sibling for getting out but god this just sucks all around.   I’ll be sure to update yall when i make it out✌️",

    "selftext": "I currently live home with my parents. 5 years ago my parents got a German shepherd and he very much was my parent’s dog rather than a “family” dog. They were overly protective about him, wouldn’t let me walk him, would hardly let me near him, they never trained him and he sits all day in a kitchen by himself while all of us work late full time. He gets no mental stimulation and he’s a very anxious and unsocialised dog, never being around other dogs or people. He also barks 24/7.  As for why I might be the asshole here. My parents go on holiday often, usually for max 4 days. They will tell me well in advance when they are going. While they are gone, I look after the dog. He’s not a particularly easy dog to deal with on my own, so my girlfriend will come on weekends to help me out with him. It’s hard to look after him but I live there and my parents have given me lots of notice that they’ll be gone so I’m okay with it.   Well, my girlfriend and I have just bought a house which is an hour drive from where I currently live for numerous reasons. Granted, we have found a house way quicker than we originally thought we would but my parents have been aware of us planning to move in together and where we wanted to live. Months ago my parents gave me a few dates of when they would be away for me to look after the dog.   Two of the dates are on weekends, which is fine but one of the dates is during the week. I agreed to it at the time and didn’t think much of it because I thought I would still be living at home anyway.   Now that we’re moving very soon and I’m looking for a job in the town we are moving to, I told my parents I might not be able to look after him during that week and gave all my reasons why but told her the weekends are fine. My mum absolutely blew up at me, saying a lot of things and how she will now have to cancel her holiday. I suggested pet sitters, kennel boarding and other family members to which she all said no to. I told her this is the kind of thing you think of when getting a dog and that there could be times in his 15 year life span where I’m not able to run back and forth to her house to look after him and that there are solutions for this to which she said “oh so this is all my fault then?” After she asked me to take annual leave and I said that wasn’t fair, I offered to  help her find a good boarding kennel for him and cover the cost. She said no, end of.   We now aren’t talking because she believes I’m being unreasonable and says that it’s my fault she’s now loosing non refundable money. I said there are solutions but she keeps saying no and her reasonings boil down to the dog not being trained or socialised.   I feel bad about their holiday but I also don’t think it’s fair that it all comes down to me to look after the dog that was their own decision to get, and a stupid decision considering their lifestyle. However they DID ask me months ago to do this and I agreed, plans can change but I still said I would do it.",

    "selftext": "I (24f) went out to dinner with my partner and a group of friends. The restaurant was quiet as there weren’t many people and sat in a booth against a half-wall next to a couple sitting on the opposite side closest to me and my partner. I was responding to a text when I overheard a conversation the boys were having. They were sharing stories about catching a friend masturbating or finding him naked when they showed up to his house. It was “bar talk” that was inappropriate for the setting. I, along with a girlfriend (I’ll call her H), weren’t actively participating but regrettably chose not to act even though we are both capable of using our voices. The gentleman next to us raised his voice and said, “Hey! If you want to talk about that shit, take it elsewhere!”   The boys complained about how he should’ve asked first. They described him as aggressive, agitated, and angry. My partner wrote “buzzkill” in his phone. I defended the gentleman, saying, “He corrected you for being inappropriate.” My partner gave me a look as if telling me to stop talking. I didn’t appreciate that. H and I said his voice was stern, but wasn’t loud enough to be heard across the restaurant like they were describing. H’s boyfriend insulted him further by assuming he wanted to impress his date. They acknowledged they were in the wrong, but believed they didn’t owe him respect because he wasn’t polite. They were upset about being embarrassed and deflected blame onto the gentleman and refused to listen to me and H. I wanted to apologize, but they quickly left before I could leave the booth and approach them.  My partner excused their behavior as “what they’re used to”. I said this was social psychology at play and we were complicit in its influence, but need to take accountability and learn our lesson. You should be courteous enough to not bring up derogatory subjects in a setting where people can hear you without depending on a stranger to correct you. You are adults who know better and can handle being reprimanded without getting defensive about the way they say it. The gentleman gave them plenty of time to move on, but got fed up with it. He responded with, “We would have respected him if he wasn’t a dick. Yelling was escalating the situation.”   We have no clue what their lives are like. What if they are going through a hard time and wanted to enjoy a peaceful meal, but were met with adult boys with the maturity of a teenager. If you act inappropriately in public, expect to be met with that same energy. Don’t expect strangers to respond in the way you want them to. You are in control of your actions. Be a better person by apologizing for your behavior. If we spoke to them, the conversation could’ve surprised us in a positive way, but none of us got the opportunity. Everyone in my friend group, including myself, sucks. Is there a perspective I’m not seeing? How appropriate was everyone’s response to the situation?",

My partner's parents just gave us this old pizza oven they had. It works great, but there's not much room for it. Our kitchen is tiny and the little bit of counter space we do have is constantly used. Bob was very unhappy when the oven went out, despite it ultimately being his fault for never properly cleaning or maintaining it. Greg tried to fix it, but it was a hopeless endeavor.  When we got the pizza oven today, I set it on the stove top temporarily to show Bob &amp; Dave. Bob immediately told me to get rid of it because we don't have room, and that we (me and Greg) need to replace the oven since it stopped working when we used it. We have no issues pitching in for a new or even used one, but I feel its unfair that we should cover the whole cost.  Im currently waiting for Greg to get home from work, but im currently in the mindset of saying \"screw you and the oven\" and just keeping the pizza oven in the basement for us to use when we want to.   WIBTAH if I don't allow Bob (and possibly Dave) to use the pizza oven and don't contribute to or cover the cost of a new oven?",

    "title": "AITA for blaming my gf if my puppy chewed up her things?",
    "selftext": "I have a dog that, while she was a pup, had a bad habit of chewing on things. I bought her toys, puzzles, snuffle mats. She, like most puppies, grew out of chewing once she was done teething. I now have another new puppy. He has started teething and trying to chew on things. Yesterday he got one of my plants. I corrected his behavior, gave him a toy, cleaned up the mess and went about my business. I got a text message today with a picture attached. The message said \"**** is a fucking dick\" and in the picture was my gfs license that had the corner chewed up. (Just a little back story on the license, we've lived together in the same house for almost 4 years and the license still has the address of her ex husband's house which is an entirely separate issue all together, her license is two months away from expiring and she also usually keeps it in her phone case so he wouldn't have been able to get it anyway.) I asked what happened and she said she took it out because she needed it. I haven't responded to her text because it made me mad that she thinks he's the dick for chewing it up. Am I the asshole for wanting to tell her that he's a 3 month old puppy that wouldn't have been able to get to the license if she had put it up and that it's also not valid because it isn't even accurate? Especially after having to replace 6 of her iPhone chargers after the last puppy chewed them up because she wouldn't unplug them and put them away. I don't see how this is my puppies fault when he is literally just doing what puppies do.",

    "title": "AITA for making a handmade gift",
    "selftext": "I (23 F) have spent the last 7 months or so writing a short book, about 150 pages, for me and my partner’s (24 M) anniversary. We've been dating for 5 years now and I wanted to do something super special. My partner is a big gamer, he loves games like Baldur's gate, the walking dead, and red dead redemption. When I was thinking about our anniversary I had the idea to write a love story about a happy yellow tiefling that bakes(based on me and my interests) and a suave bearded artificer(my partner) falling in love in a sweet novella style.Would it sell over a million copies, no. But it was from the heart and I put so many little references from our lives and love story in it that I shed a tear many times writing it. I even included his childhood cat that passed away when he was young. She was a ginger ghost cat that threw up magic items. I even got a close friend of mine to do some book binding and draw a cover for it. It was the main characters looking into each other's eyes with the ghost cat curled around his neck. We decided on a stay in movie night and marathoned all of the Transformers movies as that was his favorite. He made dinner for the both of us and after the third movie had ended and we finished dinner, I mentioned I had a gift.I pulled out the handmade book and said something along the lines of, “it isn't exactly our real life story, but you inspire me so much i just had to write about how truly magical you make life feel every day.” My partner flipped through a few pages looking very surprised. He gave me a kiss and said “thank you, this is really cool”, and that was it. We finished all the movies with casual conversation until we got back to our bedroom to go to bed for the night. He stopped me before my shower and said that while my gift was nice, it made him feel like a failure. Like I said before, both of us are not well off and are pinching pennies daily, the fact that we had the time and money to have a nice dinner was a delicacy. He went on to say things like. “You know how strapped for cash I am and then you do something like this. You know im not the creative type and dont have enough friends that can do favors for me like that, you knew I couldn't get you a gift and you pull this out as if im supposed to give you something just as good when you know i cant, its cruel.” I was astounded to say the least, not once had I asked him about a gift for myself in return or even expected one, I did it out of the kindness of my heart because I love him and wanted to make him feel special. When I said this to him his main argument was , “but I never asked you too.”I'm a total mess. I worked so hard on this gift and now I feel like a total idiot. I didn't know he would feel this way, it had never even crossed my mind that he would take offense. I'm torn, part of me feels like my efforts aren't appreciated but the other part of me is saying that he's kinda right and I should have done something small to not make him feel inferior. AITA?",

    "title": "AITA for leaving a job my friend got me into?",
    "selftext": "My friend and her husband both work for an authorized retailer in mobile sales. They offered me a management position at one of their stores, and at first I was so excited, my first management job.. I was proud and ready to prove myself.  But after the honeymoon phase wore off, I realized what I actually signed up for. The company pays managers “salary,” but it’s not real salary. If I miss a day, they take it out of my check. I work overtime every week and don’t get paid for it.  A few weeks ago my mom was vomiting blood. She’s a heavy drinker and it scared me to death. My dad wasn’t doing anything, so I took her to the hospital and missed two days of work. When I got my check, they deducted a few hundred dollars.  I also only have one sales rep, who’s shared between three stores. I have an 18-month-old baby, so if anything happens and I need to call out, it’s a massive deal &amp; I still lose pay. There’s zero work-life balance and that’s something I specifically asked about when I accepted the job.  The group chats are toxic too. People constantly post clips of others working and make comments about what they did wrong. It’s embarrassing and just creates tension. Everyone complains about it, but the owner doesn’t care.  Between the hours, stress, and never seeing my kids, it’s just not worth it. So today I put in my two weeks.  After that, my friend texted me super upset, saying she and her husband “stuck their necks out” for me. I’ve never argued with her before, so it really caught me off guard. I get being disappointed, but the way she said it made me feel like I owed her my peace and sanity.  Since then I’ve had calls from her husband, my manager, and even the president of the company, but nobody’s actually addressing the bigger issue. It’s like they just want to guilt me into staying.  Now I’m wondering am I the asshole? For quitting when the store only opened two months ago? And am I the asshole in this friendship for not sticking it out?  Part of me feels weird about the whole “stuck our necks out” thing. Yeah, they helped me, but they also needed a manager. I already had experience and didn’t need to be trained, which saved the owner money. I helped rebuild that store’s reputation from the ground up all for what basically comes out to $15/hour “salary” with no overtime and no balance.  I’m grateful they thought of me, but I can’t ignore how miserable it’s been. I did what I had to do for my kids and my peace.",

    "title": "AITA for inviting few guys to the halloween party?",
    "selftext": "So, our friend group (about 10 people) is planning to celebrate Halloween at a countryside cottage. My friend (let’s call her G) and I (18F) took responsibility for finding the place, since everyone else in the group wasn’t really active. I managed to find a really good option - the cottage costs €250 and can fit 20-25 people. Everyone liked this option, but we didn’t have enough people to fill it. So, we decided to invite a few guys from another class. We made a poll with the options “invite,” “don’t invite,” and “I don’t care.” Most people voted “I don’t care” or “invite”. Nobody voted “don’t invite.” So I added those guys to the group chat. The moment I added them, G started messaging me privately. She got upset because we had agreed to wait a couple more days before adding anyone. But I needed to call the owner the next day to confirm whether we were definitely booking the place, so I didn’t want to wait any longer. And when we did the poll, nobody seemed to have any issues with inviting those guys, or me adding them. G also said she doesn’t like one of the guys and told me I was stupid for adding him to the group. I told her that if she didn’t want him there, she could’ve just said so, because I can’t read minds. G got really mad at me, and I got upset too. I told a couple of our friends about what happened, and they all said that G could’ve just mentioned she didn’t want that guy there - we would’ve handled it or decided something else. Anyway, I got a bit heated and decided that I won’t take part in the Halloween celebration because of this incident and also because of a few other things related to the cottage that happened earlier.  So IATA for adding them?",
