    "selftext": "Hi, On Father's Day of this year,  my aunt and uncle had my dad [70] and I [30M] over for food and such. During this gathering, I gave my dad a $25 gift card to Lowe's for Father's Day. I was self conscious about this gift as it wasn't much money and I could conceivably afford more, but I had already spent a lot of money that weekend on gifts for a couple other people and this was what I decided was right for me at the time. And frankly, he wasn't a very good father, so he should have been happy he got anything. There isn't a card in the store I could buy him and mean it. Too much has happened. Taylor Tomlinson has a good bit that conveys my exact feelings.  Soon after I gave it to him, he starts making fun of it, saying that he spent like $80 on the food he brought. My aunt chimed in condescendingly, \"what can you buy with $25, [my name]?\" I sat there and took it, trying to let it go. The rest of the gathering passed without incident.   As I drove home, I got more and more angry. This was a PERFECT example of why I don't like my father. It exemplified so many things. I was staying with my mom at the time, and when I got home she could tell I was upset. I eventually told her what happened, including that my aunt had chimed in. I broke down and texted my dad and called him a fucking asshole. My mom has seen my struggles with my father and she was even more mad than I was. She eventually said she was going to text my aunt and give her a piece of her mind. I knew this would only make things worse, but 30 years of rage was boiling over in me and I was too pissed off to care. She texted my aunt \"You have highly disappointed me that you belittled [my name] with the gift he gave his father.\" She said my aunt would do the same thing if my mom had insulted one of her kids. My adult sister agreed. I also tend to agree.  The following afternoon I got a text from my aunt saying that she was sorry and she thought we were just joking around. I accepted her apology and told her she and I were fine but my father and I have ceased getting along.   Soon after I sent my father a letter addressing what my therapist and I consider to be years of psychological abuse from him, telling him that my relationship with him will not move forward until he reads it.   Things have been pretty cold with my aunt and uncle since all this happened. I saw them for the second time since Father's Day at a family party (my dad wasn't there) and my uncle called me out for going and crying to my mommy about what his wife said. I retorted that I didn't ask my mom to do that, but I don't really blame her for doing it. He said it was an overreaction and that we had all been drinking and that I was out of line. AITA?",

    "selftext": "I don‚Äôt have kids so I wanted to gauge how I turn out in this story. I have a nephew that is 2yo and 2 days ago was the first time I was asked by my sister to babysit. (I had been asking to babysit since he was born). I was super excited and moved my work schedule so I could do it. Note: when anyone is asked to babysit, her Husband is always home. He works at home and they have someone babysit so he can focus on working.  The babysitting was for a couple hours in the morning, everything seemed to go well. I had checked with my sister beforehand to ask if I could take my nephew to the park a half block away. Her husband said to just let him know when I was taking him. I did. I was also asked to babysit yesterday, again everything went fine. Fast forward to today, I was asked to babysit again. (My BIL was home) I texted him to let him know I was taking my nephew for a walk.   So this is where AITA comes in. He called me a couple minutes later asking where I was at, clearly angry. He said they really prefer if people ask permission before taking their son anywhere because ‚Äúyou just freak out if your kid is gone‚Äù. I said I could definitely bring him back no problem. He said no it‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm just saying. (Annoyed/angry the whole time) When I got back he didn‚Äôt come upstairs through the whole time even up to when I left their house. I also told my sister about the situation and she said its better if I phrase things as a question.. Again I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in the wrong because I did text beforehand and the park is literally just a half block away in an enclosed neighborhood. But I also don‚Äôt have kids so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs normal? AITA?",

    "selftext": "So my friend of 10 years has stopped talking to me at the moment and I need to know if it's mainly my fault. She's always been abit awkward with me- for example got annoyed when I wouldn't lend her money for dr*gs etc.   Anyway-I've suffered with bad depression and struggle to leave the house the last year since my dad died- something I'm working on gradually though to get to my old self!   My texting isn't great at all as I don't focus on being on my phone I try to occupy myself with other things so the last few months I haven't been great at texting.  My friend and I haven't spoken loads the last few months but I'll message her every few days and say hi how are you, just to make sure she's okay.  A few weeks ago I sent her a few messages trying to make conversation and she ignored me. A few days later I sent her a photo of my newborn niece to which she ignored. Then yesterday I messaged her to say hey is everything okay and she responded saying that she doesn't see the point in messaging me anymore because all I do is ask how she is and then she won't hear from me till the day after/2 days later.  Personally I don't see an issue with talking every few days but I want to understand where she's coming from also. She told me I don't leave the house to see her or try to talk to her properly so what's the point in trying.  Personally I think this is inconsiderate as she knows I've been struggling- but then am I not seeing things from her point of view ? I told her I don't see an issue with texting every few days to see how she is but she told me that it's draining trying to explain why it annoys her- so what nowüôÉ",

    "selftext": "My wife (25f) and me (27m) are trying to make plans for the holidays and this year, my wife wants to do Christmas with her family.¬†  Wife‚Äôs family are not very nice to her. They pick on her a lot. Like backhanded comments that are supposed to be jokes. Particularly her brothers, but occasionally her dad too.¬†  So I texted her mom (52f), dad (51m), and brothers (22m, 28m, 30m) without telling her and said that we are excited to be with them for Christmas, but asked them to please keep their snarky comments to themselves. I told them that the comments calling her immature, dumb, and annoying are unnecessary and rude and they really hurt her feelings. Her dad responded that my wife has always been a bit sensitive and this is just the way things are with siblings.This got back to my wife because her mom sent her screenshots of the text messages and she said to please don‚Äôt create anymore drama during the holidays.  Here‚Äôs my justification for this text:  \\- She got a porch goose for Christmas which she asked for and she was really excited and telling all the clothes she wanted to make for it. Her brother rolled his eyes and said she was immature. Then she got really embarrassed and just seemed sad. This happened several more times when she was opening gifts. When I asked her to show me some of the patterns for the clothes she was going to make the porch goose later, she just got embarrassed again and said she didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. (I would like to point out that she is a full time nanny and housekeeper to 3 kids so even if it were immature, she has an excuse.)  \\- Sometimes her brothers will just randomly call her dumb. Like at her family‚Äôs 4th of July get together, she and one of her brothers were going back and forth about roundabouts and he just shut down the conversation by saying he doesn‚Äôt argue with people who didn‚Äôt go to college and she said almost nothing the rest of the night, even after we got home.  \\- My wife lost a good deal of weight a few years back, but her family is constantly commenting on her food choices and how much or little she eats and few months to ‚Äúkeep her on track‚Äù they remind her that most people who lose weight gain it all back.  In spite of all this, most of the time her family is pleasant to be around but it‚Äôs like they just can‚Äôt help themselves and need to make these digs at her. When I try to or she tries to say, don‚Äôt say that, it‚Äôs always ‚Äújust a joke‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre reading too much into it.‚Äù It‚Äôs just hard for me to see this happen. When I try to bring it up to her, she closes down or says that it‚Äôs just how her family is.  I just don‚Äôt want to spend another holiday  watching her try to brush it off.¬†  Now according to my wife, my MIL, FIL, and BILs are all mad at me and according to them I have already ruined Christmas in October. Maybe I should have left this up to my wife but I know she wouldn‚Äôt do it.  AITA for telling my in laws to not pick on my wife?",

    "title": "AITA for wanting to split living costs with BF instead of paying market rent to him?",
    "selftext": "Me (51F) and my BF (51M) of 4 yrs are planning to move in together. We are both divorced, and we both own a home. My kids are in college, and his are in high school, so the plan is for me to sell my house and move into his house with him and his boys (16M and 14M) who live approx. 80% of the time with him.  We don't plan to get married, and his house will continue to be owned solely by him.  Moving into his house (vs. mine) is less disruptive to the boys, and provides a shorter commute for both of us.  I offered to pay half of all living costs (utilities, property tax and insurance), but on his mortgage I suggested only paying half of the amount of the interest payment, and none of the amount attributable to principal.  My thinking is that the portion of the mortgage payment that goes to principal increases the equity he owns in the house, and only he benefits from it since my name will not be on title.  He agrees to splitting utilities, but instead of me paying half of other costs, my payment would be based on market rent rates.  His mortgage does have a low interest rate, and he feels I should not benefit from him having a low interest rate.  I feel like we are moving in as a couple, and even though we are not married, as a couple we should more or less split things.  For additional context, we both earn a good living with 6 figures, with me earning slightly more. He is more frugal overall, and I spend more on other stuff as I am more likely to buy more expensive wine, foodie items, etc. (and that has been the case during our relationship overall).  We both earned significantly more than our ex-spouses did, but he probably has more trauma from alimony etc. payments to his ex from the divorce.  Our finances are, and would remain, separate.  I don't feel right about paying more than he does.  With his math, I would pay about 55% of living costs (if I agree to pay also half of his principal/equity mortgage payment portion), or about 78% of true living costs (if we exclude his mortgage principal payment).  So, AITA for only wanting to pay true half of living costs, without contributing to the equity/principal portion of his mortgage payment?  \\*\\*\\*Adding couple clarifications. ¬†   \\---If I sell my house, I would cash out on the equity I have and could reinvest that (in the stock market, investment property or something else). ¬†Should this not work out I could also use that to buy another place for myself. ¬†   \\---We are planning on a cohabitation agreement. ¬†  \\---We live in California so common law rules do not apply. ¬†  \\---The market rent he suggests is about half less than what one would pay to rent a full house, but also about half more than what rent for room only would be. ¬†We would both save in monthly costs moving in, and my point is more on the principle of splitting costs evenly (minus the mortgage equity portion).",

    "title": "AITA for talking behind my coach's back while she was near?",
    "selftext": "During the school season, I was in a soccer club team with all of my best friends. We've been on this team since last year, with the same coaches and teammates. Throughout the season, our one coach Rebecca has been kind of off from the start with me specifically. Flashback to a year ago, I tried out for a higher club division in the summer and I ended up not making it despite having similar athleticism, skill, and positivity as others who made it - Rebecca was coaching that team that year. It obviously was devastating since soccer means a lot to me and I really wanted to make that team but this didn't mean I was putting others who made it down or talking negatively in any sort about the people involved in the situation.   So when this year's season started, I already had let go of the summer and what had happened, and was playing with a good mindset and positivity. I was cheering others on the best I could, being polite to all coaches including Rebecca, and pushing myself at every practice and tournament. However, I could already sense Rebecca didn't really like me as much as the other people on my team or that something was off but I didn't understand why because I've never done anything to her that past year (turns out I was right). My coach also tends to be on the harsher side and visibly had favourites last year and they aren't on the team this year. Another issue we had this season was the fact that there was a mix-up about who captains were. Long-story short, it was originally me, and my other friend but it got switched arbitrarily to other people, as coaches don't really care about who captains are as long as there are three. That also caused a bit of drama which will be relevant later on.   One tournament day, all four of us \"captains\" were going to go talk to the other team's captains but Rebecca gave a bit of a dismissive opinion that only two of us should go. I understand more than two captains is a bit absurd, but I felt like I couldn't have a say in who should go and what. After the game, I went to my friends and shared how I felt about how Rebecca worded things and how it felt a bit harsh and unnecessary. I wasn't aware that Rebecca overheard our conversation and next practice it became a rule that no captains were allowed anymore. I talked to the coaches about it and their reasoning made sense but I felt that there was no value in doing that because it just made team tension worse. One other coach fully understood how me and my friends felt, and agreed that it might have been overboard. AITA for how things turned out? AITA for just stating my opinion on something with my close friends?",

    "selftext": "So I‚Äòm not in the habit of lecturing people on their manners or whatever. I‚Äôm not exactly great with social cues myself (part of the reason for this post), and I‚Äôm not confrontational at all, so even if something feels weird I tend to just shrug it off. But this caught me off guard!  I was at lunch with a few coworkers (all 30s, various genders). I don‚Äôt even remember what we were talking about in particular, just work-related chat. There were 5 of us, all having one conversation at one table. One guy was saying something, but then he paused, and instead of continuing out loud, he leaned over to his friend and whispered something behind his hand into her ear. They started giggling, she whispered behind her hand back to him, they giggled some more.  It felt really awkward. The rest of the table went silent because they‚Äôd stalled the conversation. We are all adults, and I‚Äôm pretty sure I haven‚Äôt seen anyone do that kind of thing since high school.  So I tried to joke about it by saying something along the lines of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt whisper behind your hands! what are you saying about me?‚Äù They got defensive, and said not to worry about it and it wasn‚Äôt my business.  I didn‚Äôt actually think they were talking about me. But I thought whispering like that was considered very childish and rude to the other people present? Then again, like I said I‚Äôm not great with social cues, so maybe this is a prissy complaint on my part? Should I have just turned to my other coworkers and moved on while they did their thing?

    "selftext": "I (20F) was the primary caretaker for my grandma for about 4 years before she passed away this last April. I saw my grandma all the time, especially in comparison to my family, who barely visited. When she passed, my direct and extended family obviously showed up to go through her belongings and take what they wanted.   One of these being my sister (31F), who shared a birthday with my grandma. While everyone else grabbed vintage dishes, scrapbooks, and antiques,  I grabbed a few small knick-knacks like her glasses case and mini ceramic cat. I also took her bed frame (it was going to be donated and I needed one for college anyway). When it came to jewelry, my cousins took nearly everything.   My mom and I did the last sweeps of the house, taking leftover items either to our house or the dump. My sister also left some of her chosen stuff at our house temporarily. Everything just kind of piled up for a while while we grieved.  A month later, I started sorting through my pile and found a gold ring. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd accidentally grabbed it or if someone had tossed it in my stuff, but I was honestly happy to have something to wear everyday to remind my of my grandma. I regretted not grabbing any jewelry when we first went through her things.  For the past 6 months, I've worn this ring daily. It's a simple gold ring with green gem. This morning, my sister came over, saw it sitting in my jewelry tray, and immediately started yelling that I'd stolen it from her. She said that it was her birthstone (her and my grandma's shared birthday) and that our grandma said she should have it. Then she told everyone in our family that I stole her ring and left without another word.   For context: my sister only wears silver jewelry, while I've always been a gold girl. This ring also fits me perfectly and does not fit her at all. And now she says she is keeping it hidden from me to get it resized for herself.   What frustrates me most is that I've always valued sentimental items and take good care of them. My sister, on the other hand, has let her kids destroy multiple childhood items I passed down to them, which were things that meant a lot to me.   One of her main arguments is that I \"took a lot\" from Grandma because I display everything openly in my room. Meanwhile, she took boxes of old photos, antiques, and holiday dishes that are stored away. So, visually, it looks like I have more, which makes her story much more believable to our family.   So, am I the asshole for thinking I should get to keep the ring? (I probably can't even get it back now.)",

The three of us are big on our tech and have fairly expensive set ups with mine and chris‚Äôs set up being in the living room and my yun‚Äôs setup in our bedroom; bc of all of the expensive stuff I have a security cam set in the living room (not hidden) and turned on at night or when no one is home to make sure if someone breaks in, we‚Äôve got footage(it‚Äôs happened before). All three of us have access to it except for noh and cher bc they declined access.   I make sure cher is aware of the cam and is ok with it and she says it makes her feel safe.   Couple of weeks go by and cher is suddenly saying she didn‚Äôt know the cam was in the living room, that she feels unsafe, she doesn‚Äôt want yun and chris watching her without her knowledge, it‚Äôs illegal to record people without consent, it‚Äôs triggering to her, etc.  I told her that she and I spoke about it before and she stated she was okay with it and she said I was gaslighting her at that point.   I want to make a point: the camera isn‚Äôt active while people are home and turns on via a schedule set at 2AM and turns off at 6AM.   Other issues arose and they have since moved out but I can‚Äôt help but think if I was in the wrong and indeed an AH for getting the cam in the first place.",

    "title": "AITA for not eating my MIL's food",
    "selftext": "I (24 F) have been together with my boyfriend (29 M) for 3 years now. We are from different cultural backgrounds, although it's not very noticeable in our everyday lives or in the relationship in general.  I have been a vegetarian for 10 years now. It was something I chose in my early teens, as I have always felt a deep connection to animals. It was always respected by my family and was never a problem in our household. That said - I have always, and I mean ALWAYS, respected everyone's personal decisions. I would never even suggest to someone that they should become a vegetarian -  that is not my choice, not my life, and not my business.  So, I have obviously gotten to know my boyfriend's family well during the 3 years that we have been together. I like them all a lot -  even love them. His father is welcoming and warm, his siblings are funny and kind, and all of them try to help me understand all of their conversations (me and my boyfriend have different native languages). The only issue I have experienced is with his mother. Don't get me wrong, I like his mother, I really do; however, there has been one reccuring problem that has grown more evident throughout the years.  The main topic of conflict between me and my boyfriend's mother is the fact that my \"MIL\" is always trying to serve me meat. She insists on serving me dishes with either larger pieces of meat, or sometimes even disguises it by mixing small chunks of meat throughout the dish. She has also insisted that a meal is vegetarian while actually using broth made from meat and bones. She usually says that something is vegetarian, so that I will try it, and later reveals that it is actually made from meat.  I understand that it sometimes can be difficult to know which products are vegetarian and which are not. The issue, however, is that I have tried, time and time again, to explain and clarify what I can and cannot eat. The first few times I visited their home, I had to turn down food with meat in it and explain why. After that, she started \"hiding\" the fact that some dishes are made with meat.  My boyfriend has stood up for me a few times and told his mom off for continuing to serve me meat-based food, as it can also cause my stomach to become quite upset. He has, however, also said that it is considered rude of me to refuse to eat his mother's food and has explained her actions as a difference in culture. He has even been mad at me for implying that his mom can't cook, or that I don't respect their culture.  I, of course, do not refuse to eat everything my \"MIL\" cooks, but at some point, I started getting frustrated and suspicious of some of the things she cooks. I have even asked my boyfriend if I can cook, or at least help cook, my own meal (this did not help the situation). I understand that there are cultural differences, and I really do not want to come off as rude, inconsiderate or ungrateful, as she is hosting us both when we visit their home. But at some point, I feel like I need to stand up for myself.  So, AITA?     Edit: I have noticed that a lot of people have found my previous post. I have deleted it for my own peace, as I have gotten a lot of judgement from it. I know it is easy to pass judgement on people on the internet, but as all humans, relationships are complicated and sometimes it is easy to judge without having full insight into a situation. I am a bit overwhelmed by all the responses, so I will ty to respond in my own time.   And yes, I am a people pleaser and have had issues to stand up for myself, I am trying to work on that.",

    "title": "AITA for telling my roomate that her best friend's fiance is not invited to our parties?",
    "selftext": "I (27F) live with my boyfriend (25M) and his sister (27F) who is also one of my good friends. I will refer to my boyfriend's sister as my roomate throughout this post, but I wanted to be clear that our lives are more intertwined than your average roomates. We frequently have friends come over and host parties, and the vibes are good, EXCEPT... when my roomate's best friend's fiance comes around. I will refer to my roomate's best friend as R and her best friend's fiance as J.  J has been a source of discomfort in the friend group since he started dating R. He has shown many times that he holds bigoted beliefs and he is emotionally abusive to R, who we care about. Not only that, but R and J constantly argue, even at these gatherings where we're all trying to have fun. After months of this, it began to reach a point where all our friend group talked about was how much they hated J, mostly because my roomate kept bringing it up in conversation. Even at parties, most of our friends were eavesdropping on their arguments or complaining about how terrible J was to R, and nobody was having any fun. Yet, my roomate wasn't willing to stop inviting R and J to parties because she was worried R would be isolated.  While I understand, I have been in an abusive relationship before, and was not only very triggered by J, but also sick of how my roomate's enabling was affecting everyone. I set a boundary and said I did not want J coming to our parties anymore, and everyone agreed. My roomate didn't agree, but respected is and told R that J was no longer welcome.  R then got angry at everyone for not \"talking to her\" about it, expressing no care about how uncomfortable they had made everyone. Since then, they have not been in attendance at group gatherings, and while we were sad that R chose J over us, we understood. Since then, things have been fine.  It's been a few months, and my roomate has been repeatedly bringing up how J \"took it to heart and has changed\". I don't believe that anyone is capable of changing their whole personality and belief system in a year, never mind a few months, and have expressed my skepticism. Recently, my roomate and my boyfriend were both talking about this, and my roomate mentioned that she had invited R and J to our upcoming party.   I didn't say anything at the time (my bad, I know) but I saw this as a boundary violation, and was pissed that my roomate had not asked us how we felt about inviting R and J beforehand when we had already made it clear that J was NOT welcome. It took me awhile to talk to my roomate about it because she gets very sad when she is confronted with anything, and I find her reaction to be triggering (OCD + guilt = bad combo), but once I worked up the courage, she just kept insisting that it wasn't fair for me to make blanket judgements, that I should \"give him a chance\" and that J has changed. She is not willing to reinstate the boundary we all agreed upon. AITA?",

    "selftext": "Hi Reddit,  My roommate moved in a year ago after I went through a breakup and couldn't afford the rent by myself. I rent the house owned by my parents, and I sublet a space within it to my roommate.   No cohabitation is ever perfect, my roommate is messier than me, and doesn't always clean after herself. I didn‚Äôt give up, but I decided to just clean the common areas to my liking rather than repeatedly asking her to help. But she pays rent on time and that is a big help.  When she moved in she had a lot of things, much more than was disclosed to me, and more than could fit in her space, so I asked her to move to the downstairs area so we could both reclaim some space and for me to not feel so cluttered.  After she moved in, I very quickly realized that the existing fridge was way too cramped for two people not sharing the same food, so for both our comfort I looked for another fridge and found a cheap second hand one and we moved the previous one to the garage as an extra. That worked better, we shared the big new fridge and freezer half half until it broke recently. I spent a few hundred dollars to try to fix it, buy new parts to save on the repair, but I ended up calling a fridge specialist after failed attempts, and he told me it was beyond repair.  I didn't want to buy a new fridge, but their life spans are so short now, and not wanting to go through another broken fridge adventure or keep splitting the previous one, I decided to go for it. I didn't feel it appropriate to ask my parents (the landlords) for a new fridge as the one that came with the house still works just fine.  So I bought the new fridge two days ago and it‚Äôs being delivered tomorrow. I spent 2400$ on it and it's the biggest investment I've made in a very long time. I work three jobs to make ends meet so this is a big deal for me.  The freezer is definitely too small to share (the whole fridge is smaller), and I feel comfortable asking her to use the garage freezer. But I would really like to be able to enjoy my whole new fridge by myself, so it stays organized and cared for to make it last. The other fridge is right next door to the kitchen, although I know it's more of a hassle to access by default. But she would have the whole thing to herself.  I want things to feel fair, but I don't want to be frustrated either. I feel selfish, but also like it makes sense since I bought it and there's the other one. So WIBTA if I told my roommate she can't use the kitchen fridge, just the garage one?",

    "selftext": "I (29M) am from India and moved to Canada a few months ago for work. I share a 2 bedroom apartment with a flatmate (28F). We get along really well in general. She even introduced me to her friends and defended me once when some people were harassing me. I have struggled to make other friends here so I really value our friendship. Even though most of her friends are girls I feel like they've accepted and welcomed me.  Back home we always wash with water after using the toilet and I have never used toilet paper in my life. I find it dirty and uncomfortable. It feels unhygienic and sometimes parts of it stick, so for me it is not clean unless I wash with water. Since our landlord refused to let me install a bidet seat, what I have been doing is cleaning myself in the tub or shower right after pooping. I do not use any toilet paper at all. I always rinse the area and the tub well after, use soap, and make sure everything looks clean.  A few weeks ago my flatmate brought it up and said she does not want me to do that anymore because she \"found poo in the drain.\" I told her I do not believe that because she never showed me, and I am always careful. She has long hair and from the start we agreed she would be responsible for cleaning the shower drain because it is mostly her hair clogging it.  What also bothered me is how she even figured it out. She admitted that she could tell because she hears the shower turn on right after the toilet flushes since her bedroom is next to the bathroom. That actually made me uncomfortable because it means she has been listening to what I do in there.  She got upset and said it is disgusting and not normal here. I tried to explain that this is normal where I am from, but she said I should adapt. I asked the landlord again about a bidet attachment but he said absolutely not.  I really do not want to move because rent here is super cheap. I only pay 700 for my room when most 2 bed apartments in this area go for at least 1500 per person because she has an older lease. It is modern and spacious, and I had a really hard time finding a place when I first moved. A lot of people did not even reply to my applications, and a few sent racist messages telling me to \"go back to India.\" I would have to share with 4 or 5 people to achieve something similar.  I had awful roommates before this one and compared to them she is honestly very friendly. I do not want to lose this place or make her uncomfortable, but I also do not feel clean without washing.

I work with a girl that calls everyone b..ch and she calls me it every single time I am in ever since the very first day that I have worked there. So today I go in and they start doing my job and she comes round the corner and asks if I can run out a order to drive through I go yes because it was a good opportunity to help train an employee who was currently learning tills I looked around to make sure that it was OK and that nobody was listening and nobody was near And just as she does to me quite a lot I said but just to be clear I'm not your pack b..ch in a very joking tone just like she does every single shift I have with her. I run the order out and I come back in only for my shift supervisor to come over to me and ask me what exactly I just told this employee and I told her the truth because I said I called her this because she calls me this every single shift And that I'm told that I have upset her and that I should apologise.     so I immediately go running around the store just trying to find her because I honestly just thought she took it as a joke because it's what she does all the time and I find her full on crying in a colleague's arms so I walk over there and I say her name to which the person holding her looks at me like I'm scum and tells me to leave So I do because I am just confused right now she can dish it out but the first time I've ever done it she can't take it?     so I leave so that she can calm down and when she comes to put the gravy into draws that they belong in I try to apologise and she once again blows up at me and says if I want to take this further I can keep talking So right now I am just feeling as if maybe when she was saying it to me she didn't actually mean it as a joke because it doesn't seem like she knew that I meant it as one which is concerning considering that she has called me it every single shift since I first started there I don't know am I the \\*\\*\\*\\* of a saying it or is she it.",

    "selftext": "I am 18 f and dating my bf 19 for 2 years. I am a really big fan of vivienne westwood and i want to own one of her pieces. Ofcourse they are very expensive so ive gotten myself fake pieces several times ( yes this is relevant)   My boyfriend often gets me gifts that i do not like, not always but way to often. This makes me feel like all he cares about is getting me a gift instead of getting me something because he knows me and knows what i like. Ofcourse i am very grateful and i always thank him and use / wear the stuff he gives me even when i dislike it. I have told him this.  I have always been expressive about my love for vivienne westwood and i asked him to get me one of her pieces some time. I know its expensive so i didnt tell him when, i just said its something id love to get. Id rather get one gift that i absolutely love instead of 3 i dont really like.  Ive gotten him very expensive things too and i think in total ive spend more on him gift wise but i dont really mind since he spends more on dates.Money is not a problem in our relationship we both spend relatively the same on eachother. Or for example when we go to the movies, he pays the tickets i pay for our food.When i buy him a gift i look for stuff he is passionate about and i consider his interests or what he reposts about on social media. He never asks me for anything specific so i got him a sword of one of his favorite anime characters since he likes anime and did a repost about loving swords. This was a year ago i cant really top that anymore :(   This year in august he went to Japan for a month with friends. Guess what he bought... A vivienne Westwood necklace for HIMSELF matching with his best friend. Mind you my bf didnt know anything about vivienne westwood or fashion in general before we got together. He got me some cute gifts like Hello Kitty bag chain, chopsticks, a manga in Japanese, a cool Hello Kitty t shirt and really good matcha honey. (Edit i didnt expres well enough how much i loved the gifts he got me from Japan, this was meant to show he learned to get me stuff i do like)  Now i was upset about this but i didnt want to be annoying and at the moment i thought i was wrong for being upset. This man would not stop talking about how cool and great his new necklace is and wears it everyday. When i got myself fake vivienne westwood jewelry he was judging me, saying its fake and poor quality.   Now everytime i think about this i get more and more upset. Our anniversary is next month and i asked him if we are doing gifts, he asked me if i wanted something specific and j said \" i want something ive been asking for for 2 years and you eventually bought for yourself\" he said he was planning on buying it for me for a while but he didnt know what i would like.  He said hed take me to the store so i can choose... We dont have vivienne Westwood stores in the Netherlands.   He claimed we have and i said no, ofcourse after looking it up he believed me. He said he will order online for me but i told him i dont care, i dont want it anymore.  AITA?  Edit: i see people saying i am wrong for saying i dont want it anymore. IF i said that just to be mean i absolutely understand that, but i am not 'just' saying it. I genuinely dont want it from him anymore. I realized how dumb i look basically begging for something i shouldve just saved for and gotten myself.  Can people also stop being mean and attacking our character or calling names? I was asking for thought and opinions on this specific topic not insults. If you are a miserabele person keep it to yourself no need to project to others. Just because its online doesnt mean you have to stop being a decent person, you owe everyone online and offline decentness. Keep in mind that you do not know me and i do not know you, all you know is this specific information i am providing you with from my perspective",

    "selftext": "First time writing on Reddit ever, please bare with me!   I (18f) fight often with my father (52) and think maybe this time it went too far. Little context just so you guys can understand better. He and my mother divorced when I was 9 and I've lived with my mother ever since, but they have shared custody.   After he moved out, we didn't see each other as often as it would've been good. There are MANY things that happened in the past that strained our relationship that would take way too long to explain. The important part is, that since I was about 13 we fought a lot. We have VERY different opinions and we are both stubborn. So our fights can go on for a few hours on a bad day.  Now the issue. Last week he came over to my apartment, originally just to see me and it somehow turned into a 3 hour debate about all kind of things. It switched topics A LOT and I told him that I thought he was a bad father in between. We talked about it for a while, he made a bunch of excuses but kinda apologised to me. We ended it after that and he left, but I thought the vibe was really off (obviously after something like that).   Two days later he send me this Facebook post over something we debated about. I read through it, it was about 20 minutes long. We had prior to that talked about how to not use information off of Facebook, he said he wouldn't do that, and still did it. It was full of fake information. I literally googled one thing from it and the first thing that came up? FAKE. I'm pretty passionate when I debate, thats why I made him an entire document were I listed ALL the things that were wrong in that post he send me and with sources. I wrote him this message on top of that:  \"Here's a file where I showed you that you just believed lies. Don't send me anything like that again if you can't even double-check simple facts. And I'm sorry to sound mean, but I would be ashamed to fall for something like that and accept it as truth just because I can't dedicate three more minutes to the topic.\" I also added that I still loved him, but that I needed to draw a line.  He was VERY upset. He said he thinks I am mean and presumptuous. He twisted my words to 'you're a liar and I am ashamed of you' even tho I didnt say that. He also wrote that he never said the post was 'the truth' just something I should think about. I answered him, clarifying some things and ending it with 'im done with this topic now, love you, good night.'   That was over a week ago and he hasn't responded or contacted me in any way. We fight often, but this felt different than usal. My mother and sister say I went too far with that message. A friend of mine said it was good that I did it and that he needs a reality check. I don't know if I did the right thing and that this harshness was something he actuall needed or if maybe I ruined our entire relationship with this now. Especially after the fight two days prior to that. So AITA?",

    "selftext": "So this year has been rough for my family. My mother is a single parent of 4 including me (16f), my two brothers, and sister. I am the oldest of her children and been having to step up lately.  Earlier this year him and my mother had a fight about his screen time. It has always been 1 hour on vr for everyone, including me but he has always had trouble listening to this rule. He normally gets angry when I try to rush him off after he passes and hour and when I give him an extra 5 mintues he still won‚Äôt get off when I tell him. At one point he started getting in before my mother was awake or sneaking on without asking. Him and my mother fought about how he needs to respect her rules or he can‚Äôt bring use the headset or bring the one from his fathers house. My brothers dad doesn‚Äôt care how much they go on electronics. My mom and their dad switch weeks with them on Sunday's each week. My youngest brother(11m) doesn‚Äôt ever think the rules are unfair.  When my mother and brother had an argument about the rules he went to his dads the next day like normal but when it came the night to pick him up, his father told my mother that he wouldn‚Äôt come, he didn‚Äôt feel comfortable. My mom was asking for a reason since it was the week of spring break but my brothers dad said he was scared of when she left at night to see her friends (which she does once a month) even though I am here and capable of texting her if something‚Äôs wrong and we have big dogs to protect us. All me and my siblings don‚Äôt mind when she has left in the past since she returns before 12 and is never drunk or acting wild, she always checks in and makes sure everyone is okay beforehand.  My mother went to talk to him and see if he would come to our house or just talk but at their fathers house, his father tried making my mother talk to him through the screen door as him and his wife listened. Long story short he started getting persuaded to go with my mother but saw his father and closed up. Just so everyone knows, his father is a narcissist (professionally diagnosed) and him and his wife have been discreetly harassing my mother for months.   My mother was absolutely heart broken because she loves her children and does her best, the whole situation making her mental state much worse. For the next few months she only saw him during his sports games and she would cry after, clearly distressed and wanting to see him more. She and my brothers dad went to court. He tried to get full custody of one, key word, one of my brothers while supervised visits from my mom. He didn‚Äôt talk about his other son which made it more suspicious. To shorten this, the judge told him he had to make my brothers come to our house. My brothers dad didnt exactly listen but after another court session my brother slowly started coming back.   Lately is the problem: My brother come to our house he acts like rules dont apply to him, he can eat junk food, doesnt have to do chores, and can just sit on his phone (that wasnt even supposed to be at our house but after an incident, it is). Now all hes been talking about are gifts and things he wants even though he doesnt do anything.   AITA for thinking he shouldn‚Äôt have gifts after how he has impacted my mother and our family life?  Edit: Yes, I know I shouldn‚Äôt be trying to parent but my mom has been giving into all his wishes he‚Äôs asked for and after his fathers words towards her, hasn‚Äôt been parenting him how she used to and how she does us. I haven‚Äôt said anything yet but have been inching towards mentioning his behavior. I‚Äôm taking all comments into consideration.",

    "title": "WIBTA for moving out of my cousins house in the middle of the night without telling her?",
    "selftext": "So I moved into my cousins about 2 month ago to help her with her baby. She agreed to pay me and help me with my pets expenses and things like that. Well I moved in and less than a week later she quit her job because they \"weren't giving her enough hours\" at the time her baby dad wasnt living there. About 2 weeks later he moved back in and hes also jobless. Ive been here for over a month and havent gotten any money. They pay me in dab pens and small amounts of weed. Which was fine originally but I have bills to pay. Now my biggest problem is my gecko. I have no electric in my room which means she stays in the living room and her tank doesnt get warm enough during the day mind you she has mouth rot so EVERYTHING about her environment needs to be perfect. Ive asked her to get the electric in my room working multiple times and all shed have to do is call the landlord but I keep getting brushed off. Today I told her we needed to get things working and my gecko upstairs before winter and she brushed me off I told her I want electric in my room and she said \"it sounds like alot of complaining\" I said \"I have a right to complain\" and her reaction was \"do you?\" I hate to say it but my gecko means way more to me than nannying her baby with no payment mind you they only have 1 kid and neither have jobs so they rewlly dont need me. I feel like this is completely unfair to me as I got nothing I was promised but I watch her baby constantly, I clean her house and I do everything she asks for nothing. Would I be the asshole if I just up and left in the middle of the night? Mind you I have talked to her multiple times about getting the electric in my room working and my gecko in my room to which im CONSTANTLY brushed off. Shes CONSTANTLY spending money on stuff but doesnt have enough to pay me. My life has been on hold for her and I feel like shes taking advantage of me. And the baby's dad isn't much better.   Edit: so id be leaving in the middle of the night bc im a huge people pleaser and I hate conflict. I know I need to grow a pair and get over it its just hard üò© I get guilt tripped really easily...   Edit 2: im gonna talk to them the day I move out and wont give them a chance to try to convince me to stay. I appreciate everyone replying and ill continue to read the newer replies  Edit 3: ok ig I wasnt specific enough and thats my bad, so the baby is the mother's absolute pride and joy. The baby isn't in any danger or anything. She doesn't come in contact with weed the parents dont smoke it theyre actually very strict about it understandably... idk I dont see cps doing anything bc well the baby's healthy happy fed and the house is clean and safe. The only person whos unhappy in this situation is me üòÖ i do appreciate you all for being concerned for her tho ‚ù§Ô∏è   4) im not gonna keep answering questions about weed. I smoke the parents dont. they pay me in weed bc i smoke and the BD has an uncle who gives it to him for free.  Its not near the baby at all so it shouldnt matter. Its also legal where i am and its not considered a drug here. I have my reasons for smoking it. I smoke it outside only so again it shouldnt matter. Im not gona answer anymore question about it coz its really not a huge part of the problem im facing.",

    "selftext": "Hello!   So for context, my father met and married his wife in 2019. Back then, I still lived with them and I tried really hard to get on with her. Like, we used to be fond of each other for like the first year of them being together in contrary to my brother whom she really hates because he uses every opportunity to provoke her (he‚Äôs 23 btw) and I told him like a thousand times to just leave it be. Eventually, she stopped talking to me and didn‚Äôt care for me anymore. I didn‚Äôt understand why but I also couldn‚Äôt really bother to dig any deeper because I moved out soon after (in 2021) anyway. In this timeline, we visited them a couple of times (they live 7 hours away) and never does she even greet me. She‚Äôs Orthodox and I always took the time to wish her a Merry Christmas and Easter and wrote her on her Birthdays. She never does any of that. My fianc√© proposed to me this year and I FaceTimed my father and told him. Mind you, his wife was in the same room and she didn‚Äôt even congratulate us!! I talked to my father about this and he said that because of the language barrier (she‚Äôs from Ukraine but has been living in Germany for around 8 years) and her stubbornness she‚Äôs unable to understand. And I was like, yes, but why did it work before she suddenly decided that she didn‚Äôt like me then? Anyway, we are planning to get married next year and we were originally going for a wedding without kids. I told my father and he said that if my little brother (5yo) can‚Äôt come then he won‚Äôt come as well. I was like, okay, fair, we‚Äôre allowing kids for closest family then because I can‚Äôt just not invite my father. A few days ago, he was talking to me about airbnbs and turns out, he was assuming that his wife could come. I carefully told him that we weren‚Äôt going to invite her because I don‚Äôt like her and I don‚Äôt want her at my wedding because she makes me feel uncomfortable. My father didn‚Äôt react very well and he replied that she is his wife and therefore should be allowed to come and he won‚Äôt be coming if she can‚Äôt come. I told him that he‚Äôs not coming then and we hung up and didn‚Äôt talk since that.  Honestly, I don‚Äôt know what to take from all of that. Am I the asshole for not inviting her?",

    "selftext": "hi! So I‚Äôm seeing Beetlejuice on broadway (it‚Äôs intermission right now) and there‚Äôs a kid seated next to me who proudly told me he‚Äôs in fifth grade. I asked his mom if he‚Äôs ever seen the musical before (Beetlejuice is definitely a PG-13 musical) and she said she had and it was fine. I was skeptical about sitting next to a kid and it turns out i was right- he talked through the first three numbers. So during an applause break, I turned to him and asked him to please stop talking (those exact words). His mom glared at me and told him that he doesn‚Äôt need to stop talking (which is insane to me) and that if I was bothered I should move. Thankfully, it‚Äôs a matinee and not sold out so I was able to move a few seats over. I have really good floor seats that I paid over $100 for and I‚Äôve travelled two hours from Philly and want to enjoy the show. I don‚Äôt think that I was out of line but other people around me weren‚Äôt complaining so was I being an AH?  Update/edit- hi everyone! thank you for all the comments. I should have involved the usher but the kid seemed to quieted down once I moved seats and I didn‚Äôt want anyone to get kicked out or in trouble so I didn‚Äôt involve an usher, even though I probably should have. thank you for all the comments though!",

We‚Äôve gone through a lot of changes, from school to university, to jobs to partners to friends.   Cut to now and I‚Äôm kind of pissed off at him.

    "title": "AITA for not giving my benefits to our households joint account",
    "selftext": "So our household consists of my dad my brother and me. So I first of all my mom passed away 5 years ago. I am now 21 and my brother is 23 years old.   My dad is known for us as someone you can‚Äôt discuss with in any way. For example one time I came home from the train station with my bike. I opened the garage put my bike away and close the garage door. When I came inside my dad suddenly asked angry why I closed the garage door. I said it was closed so I closed it again like any normal person would do. Then he said no it was open and he started shouting. Like why would you should for something small like that. Just open the garage door again if it bothers you that much. (The door was 100% certainly closed.)   Around 5 years ago nearly 2 weeks after my mom passed we also saw that he was paying for fictional p*rn chat sites. This disgusted us and we are now talking in amounts of ‚Ç¨ 10.000 so it‚Äôs not that it was like ‚Ç¨ 5 per month.   So about the main subject. We have a joint account where we each put on ‚Ç¨ 700 each month. This is for our monthly expenses like electricity, heating, water, etc. We also use this for things like clothes that everyone needs.   Now my employer gives me a few benefits like 30% discount on my electricity bill. I also have the opportunity to work from home and get a few benefits with that as well. I get ‚Ç¨ 75 per month for my internet paid directly to my ISP so everyone benefits from this in our household, I get ‚Ç¨ 50 per month just for working from home.   Now my dad wants me to deposit the 30% discount I get paid for the electricity discount. Honestly I don‚Äôt want to because I think ‚Ç¨ 700 per month is already a lot to pay as rent to your parents to stay home. Now I live in Belgium where the rent is not to bad but you still high and with your monthly expenses I would be a tiny bit worse off living on my own. For the people saying yeah but that‚Äôs with your food and everything. Yeah you are all right but I can live a lot cheaper than my dad and my brother.   For that and because the benefit is for me because I work in the electricity sector, I don‚Äôt want to deposit this on the joint account.   I am really hard on saving and investing my money for this reason I can really save every ‚Ç¨ I can. So do you guys think I am the AH?   Edit: so I see some people asking how the discount works. Well the discount will go on my pay check because they are not the same company as my energy bill company. The Belgian ISP‚Äôs have a system where they can use third party payment provider. The energy billing companies don‚Äôt have this I think.   Maybe an important thing as well: my brother is not an AH. We have our differences but as a whole he is not a bad person like my dad is.  Some people may think that I just want to talk bad about my dad but everything that I said in here I said for a reason. I‚Äôve been on an Erasmus exchange program in Finland and lived 4 months away from him in peace so I‚Äôve had the chance to think about my situation clearly.   Also some people telling me I should maybe move out and I thought of this many times but I am still 20 y/o and don‚Äôt really want to because I live in a strategically good place for work and friends and the area is expensive.   I have also talked to him about this a few moments ago and he agreed that I keep it. The ‚Ç¨ 75 per month is plenty for my homework expenses.",

    "selftext": "Using a throwaway as my main is used for my gaming. Obligatory posting on mobile, please excuse formatting mistakes.  I sold a vehicle to one of my partners coworkers. We were very clear that a lot of work has been done on the car and that although at this time we knew of nothing wrong with the vehicle we were selling it because we didn‚Äôt want to deal with it any more. This was repeated to them several times, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know of anything wrong, but we do not trust it.‚Äù After a test drive the coworker was confident they wanted it. So we wrote up a bill of Sale stating the terms of the sale; $3000 total paid in installments of $200 per month. And a statement that ‚Äúthis sale is final and the vehicle is sold as is, with no warranties or guarantees expressed or implied‚Äù seller and buyer singed the bill of sale and to make the registration and insurance process easier for her I signed over the title.  That was 6 weeks ago. The vehicle is now broken down, ‚Äúinternal catastrophic failure and needs a new engine.  The crank shaft and bearings have gone out.‚Äù She is now asking that we take the car back and donate it/junk it. They will just sign it back over and we can do what we want with it. It is currently about 2 hours from where we live.  I do not feel it is my responsibility to fix this problem for her, but I do feel really bad it broke down. She is now accusing my partner of taking advantage of her and saying that we never told her anything could be wrong with it.  This car has been a pain in my side since I purchased it for around $10,000 in 2020. It has had several mechanical issues that we have fixed. All in all probably putting about another $5000 into the vehicle, a lot of that very recently. A list of the things that have been replaced on it includes the battery, Alternator, Drive belt, Spark plugs, Ignition coils, Brake pads/rotors, Cam was refurbished, Valve cover gaskets, Oil/ oil filter, PCV valve, and Oil pressure sensor. Also there was fix done by our original dealership after jiffy lube failed to put oil back in the car after an oil change.  Again we were absolutely transparent about all of this and that we hoped nothing would go wrong but couldn‚Äôt promise anything. So, AITAH for refusing to allow her to return the now broken car I sold in working condition that is hours away from my home? Any idea for compromises? I can‚Äôt afford to give away thousands of dollars, but I‚Äôve been in hard situations with cars before and know what it feels like. We are in the US.",

(Yes, productions insurance covered my vehicle while on the job. I made sure of that) We were in a hurry to shuttle talent &amp; crew in and the pressure was on me at this point.   While driving from the parking lot on the first pickup I needed to make a right turn. Only problem was the driver in front of me decided to come to a complete stop outside a building and turn on his hazards. The turn lane was blocked off with a divider so there was no option for me to just drive around him. I rolled down my window and asked him if he broke down, he replied by yelling ‚ÄúUber pickup, just one moment please‚Äù. I told him absolutely not and he needed to do his pickup elsewhere but he ignored me.   I started honking at him. First a quick tap, then just a bit longer. When that didn‚Äôt work I laid down the horn for probably 15-20 seconds until he threw up his hands in frustration and finally moved forward. He yelled ‚Äúfucking jackass‚Äù at me as I passed him.

I was pretty confident on old man driving an older Prius with a Jill Stein and peace sign bumper stickers on the back was not going to shoot anyone let alone own a gun and also, he was impeding traffic and this is LA so I felt justified. The horn is a useful tool against inconsiderate drivers and I stand by that.   My producer approached me later on to ask what happened.

This past weekend I did a 5k and I trained for a couple of weeks doing it , and felt so accomplished the day I did it , I was proud of myself as this was a fitness goal I was aiming for , because of my recent 5k, I decided to put a lock on my mini fridge , so that it‚Äôs more difficult to satisfy my sweet tooth cravings , while Also serving as a way to prevent my parents from opening my mini fridge and seeing my snacks and drinks and judging me when I‚Äôm taking care of myself better , but it‚Äôs mostly to prevent me from opening the mini fridge as easily so I can controll my cravings better , my parents recently noticed the lock and while They don‚Äôt actively get something from the fridge , they said that I was being selfish and disrespectful and being immature for the lock on my own fridge , I tried explaining to them that while the lock does it make it to where they can‚Äôt open it easily , that it‚Äôs mostly for me to be able to controll my cravings better by making it more difficult to open the fridge whenever I want too , I told them that if they want something from the fridge , all they have to do is ask and I‚Äôll open it and get it from them , because I have no issue with them getting something from the fridge , but that they open the fridge without me knowing and judge me on snacks and drinks I don‚Äôt touch as often as they think .

    "selftext": "I went to test drive a Tesla and wanted my girlfriend to come along. I had an appointment scheduled, and before we went, she mentioned a couple of times that she was uncomfortable with the self-driving feature and didn‚Äôt want me to use it. I didn‚Äôt think it would be a big deal, I just wanted to experience what the feature could actually do, so I turned it on for the entire test drive. We were completely safe, nothing dangerous happened, but she was quiet the whole time and I could tell she was upset afterward.  For context, she has been in a car accident before, and I know that might make her more anxious as a passenger. I‚Äôm trying to be understanding, but it‚Äôs exhausting feeling like I can‚Äôt even drive normally without upsetting her. I get that she gets anxious sometimes, but I don‚Äôt think I should have to completely change how I drive when I‚Äôm not doing anything unsafe.  Towards the end of the drive, I asked her if I could ‚Äúfloor it‚Äù to see how the car handled. She said, ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt,‚Äù but I did anyway, just for a second, to see what it was capable of. Again, nothing unsafe or reckless happened, but she got quiet again.  Later that night, while we were driving home on the highway, there was a car ahead of us that was swerving a lot. She said something like, ‚ÄúWow, that person must be drunk, they‚Äôre swerving.‚Äù By that point, I was getting frustrated with the constant driving comments, so I said, ‚ÄúI know how to drive.‚Äù I was aware of the situation and already giving the other car plenty of space.  After that, things felt tense. When we stopped at the grocery store, she walked ahead of me and didn‚Äôt really talk. Later, she pulled me aside and said she‚Äôd felt uncomfortable in the car. I told her it felt like she just had a problem with my driving. I wasn‚Äôt trying to dismiss her feelings, I genuinely didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd done anything wrong or unsafe.  I eventually said something like, ‚ÄúMaybe you should just let me drive,‚Äù because I felt like she was micromanaging me and overanalyzing everything I did behind the wheel. She started crying and got really emotional, which surprised me.",

    "selftext": "I (48F) work full-time, often from home, and I‚Äôm a single parent to a 14-year-old. I live in a small open-plan apartment, so my kitchen, living area, and workspace are all in one space. When it‚Äôs messy, I can‚Äôt escape it.  My job is demanding and takes a lot of mental and physical energy. By the end of the day, I‚Äôm drained, and keeping up with housework feels like a never-ending battle. I‚Äôm often too embarrassed to have people over because it never feels properly presentable.  Yesterday, I used my lunch break to deep-clean the kitchen and bathroom. It took almost two hours, and I had to make up the time by working late. I was so happy to have finally got on top of a few  things and just wanted the place to stay nice for a little while.  My boyfriend (55M) doesn‚Äôt officially live with me, but he stays over about six nights a week and cooks and eats here daily. He helps where he can (loading the dishwasher, wiping surfaces, taking bins out, etc)  but the majority of jobs are on me.  When he came over after work, he brought ingredients to cook dinner. Admittedly, I was being a bit twitchy about the kitchen. I followed him around with a sponge, picked up dropped food, rinsed the sink, hand-washed utensils, and wiped counters as he cooked, which annoyed him. The moment that really set him off was when I turned a pepper grinder upright after he‚Äôd left it upside-down, leaving pepper on the counter. He snapped and said I was being passive-aggressive, making him feel incompetent, and that his nice gesture wasn‚Äôt appreciated.  I apologised and explained I just wanted to keep the kitchen nice for a while, but he was still irritated. When we sat down to eat, he asked why I looked annoyed. I said I just felt like no one respected how hard I worked to get things clean. He blew up and threatened to go home, saying he wouldn‚Äôt cook for me again.  He and my daughter had both been rolling their eyes as he cooked and saying things like ‚Äúoh god, mum‚Äôs on about the cleaning again,‚Äù which made me feel dismissed. I said I didn‚Äôt expect anyone else to deep-clean, but some acknowledgment of why I might want to keep it nice would go a long way. Instead, he told me I was controlling and that no one wants to be around me when I‚Äôm like this.  Later that night, when I got up to go to bed, I found the sink full of food scraps, the hob covered in sauce splatters, and dirty dishes left on the side. I don‚Äôt know if it was just because of the argument, but after being made to feel like I was the problem, it really felt like the final straw.  So, AITA? I genuinely can‚Äôt tell.  TL;DR: I work full-time and am a single parent. After spending hours deep-cleaning my small apartment, my boyfriend cooked, I tried to clean as he went, and he called me controlling and ungrateful. Later I found the kitchen dirty again. AITA?",

    "selftext": "Good evening. Last week i had a very heated argument (Or maybe one can even say fight) with my mother on the subjective of my (Step)sister who she had banned me from ever talking to since my birth.   It's a long story but I'll try keep it short.   Apologies in advance for the horrible English, It's not my first language.  My parents married at a very high age (\\~50), and due to this, as you can imagine, this was my father's second marriage. He had a daughter from that marriage (early 20s back then), which my mother disliked more than anything because my father paid a lot of attention to her, mentally and economically. This resulted in very heated relations, and eventually she forced her to \"Get out of their life\".      Fast forward 18 years and all this time she has banned me from ever talking to her and having any sort of contact with her because \"She ruined our life\", her reasoning is, among many she influenced my father to not be a great husband and she said she (My sister) is looking for a way to get rid of me so she can get all of the inherence.    A while ago, I finally managed to meet her in a condition where i could spend lots of time with her, and I very quickly realized pretty much all of what i heard from my mom was Bullshit and she actually, all this time really cared for me and during the 1 week time i spent with her found out we were very compatible and she was very supportive of me.  My mother finally found out about this and was unimaginably mad. I stood my ground, saying she is wrong about her and how she is my sister, and she has no right to ban me from being in contact with her.    She is very very mad and has said I'm no longer her child for disobeying her so blatantly.  So what do you think? Was i right or wrong?",

    "selftext": "My boyfriend and I are university students living in separate shared flats. We frequently alternate where we sleep. I have an independent key for his flat, but my apartment only has two keys, meaning I can't give him one.  I usually leave for the gym at 6:40 AM. My shift-working flatmate is already gone, so I am responsible for locking up. My boyfriend, a night owl, was asleep when I got up. I forgot I couldn't lock the door with him inside. I woke him, asked him to lock the door after me, and return the keys later at university - something we've done before. I placed the keys right by his phone.  Later, when I asked for the keys, he was completely unaware, having forgotten our exchange while half-asleep. This resulted in two problems:  1. The apartment door was didn‚Äôt have the deadbolt in. (which I view as unsafe). 2. I was locked out. My flatmate was only briefly home in the afternoon before leaving again for the night, forcing me to either wait until late for his return or interrupt my study day to rush home for the key exchange.  I was annoyed by the inconvenience and the partially locked door, but I didn't give him a hard time; people forget things. I texted my boyfriend, asking him to collect the keys from the flat and bring them to me at the university library. I felt this was a fair request since he was the one who had forgotten to lock up. He reluctantly agreed.  When he returned the keys at the library, he was angry. He accused me of being at fault for getting locked out and said I shouldn't expect him to listen while half-asleep. Taken aback, I simply thanked him, and he left. He later texted an apology for his grumpiness but insisted he felt unfairly treated.  The next day, he brought it up again. I explained my gratitude for him bringing the keys and my reasoning for asking him to do the trip. He stood firm that it was my fault, insisting I should have just left the door unlocked next time. Feeling his reaction was unfair and an unnecessary deflection of blame, I ended the argument and left.  **AITA for expecting him to lock the door and then asking him to collect and bring me the keys afterwards?**",

It is completely out their choice, I don't need them to live with me. I have an elder brother who is married, both of them work. He earns as much as me and SIL earns a bit lesser. But since parents don't live with him, he's not asked to pitch in for any recurring expenses. I don't think he would say no but he's not come forward to pitch in either. Though I don't think he particularly wants to live full time with them. Everytime I have broached the topic, he's dodged it.  My relationship with my father is fraught. While I love him, he still likes to extend control over my life and treat my finances as his.  He's manipulative and everytime I ask him to pick up a few of their bills, he goes \"Oh so you mean you want all of us to go separate ways\" etc.   While he has significant savings, he refuses to get a debit card or credit card or adopt any app that would enable him to make digital payments - sort of a forced financial dependence. He knows how to use all these financial devices and had a good career in the government before retiring. Instead he asks me to make all the payments. If I push back a little bit, he makes a show of \"giving me money because I asked for it\" and guilt tripping me.   I am tired of being manipulated, micromanaged and treated as a child even though I'm the one taking care of everything. I've given up a lot of my social life over the past 5 years because they're quite controlling/need me/manipulative. This is not just financial but in daily life as well. I want to move out and reduce expenses and increase my savings which would make them move in with my brother that too after much guilt tripping bs and me appearing as a the bitch in the family.

She told one roommate that i‚Äôm faking my hearing loss for attention. i only wear my hair down and don‚Äôt really talk about it much my other roommate just recently found out. and idk how you would even fake that. Made up story‚Äôs about roommates to make them sound bad. and so much more she is constantly trying to start drama and make us fight which hasn‚Äôt worked.

We are all just frustrated with the constant lies about us and her saying that we‚Äôre leaving her out when we‚Äôre literally talking in the community kitchen in are apartment bc we didn‚Äôt knock on her door to come talk to us. It just feels like she wants all of us to revolve around her and she sabotages are other friendships. We have only lived together for 2 months and it‚Äôs already miserable. I am definitely so lucky for my other 2 roommates. And just to be clear she wasn‚Äôt left out at the start she actually caused the other 2 to not like me originally bc i moved in later but we have figured everything out honestly once we all met we settled and saw past the lies bc i was also fed lies before moving in.

I looked really forward to this trip and planned a lot of stuff with my friends( it was the first time I was hanging out with such a big group, around 12 people in total) but somehow everything fell apart, the friend that was closest to me (I will call her Bee for convenience sake) Bee brought alcohol, and took it out in the bus (it was mixed with coke) I knew she could get in trouble but I didn't say much, since I didn't really care if she drank nor did I want to ruin the trip, she passed it to everyone she knew wouldn't mind, including me but I didn't drink, later on when we arrived at the hotel, we all met(all 12 of us) at one of the bigger suites, it all went well at the start and though I felt a bit excluded (my close friend was drunk af and clinged into this other girl idk) a few of our neighbours (also classmates) were scared because someone played the dingdong ditch against them, we found it funny but found no reason to be scared since I mean, we are about to go to college in a year. But those kids called the teachers, who later came to our room and to see if we were the ones behind it..but they chemistry teacher? She smelled the alcohol, she snooped everywhere, even checking the toilet, fortunately noting had happened in that room, and the teacher left with a warning, but my friends got shit scared, since their room had a can of absolute vodka and ciggerate buds in the can, so much so they said they'd bring it here, me and few other opposed that idea cuz we didn't want to get involved in this bs, but I still recommended ways to fix it, later, me, and four other girls (we had a  different room and the fourth one just tagged alone cuz she was too scared) went to our room and discussed this shit, but we heard the door move, one of us thought it might be someone eavesdropping, and then a teacher barged in, and asked who it was, we played dense at the beginning, but they already knew which room it was, and after pushing us for a good 10 minutes, one girl blurted it out in panic, and they went away, now my close friend refuses to talk to me, and says it is my fault for not stopping them( I don't know how I was supposed to since it was all so sudden and I couldn't just shyt the girls mouth right in front of the teachers TvT)  P.s. this is my first time posting here to idek shit  Update:- üòî past me was stupid for thinking the trip was the worst part, forgot about social boycott.

    "selftext": "First time posting on Reddit cause all my friends are asleep. I roommate (M19) am a college and like many have a roommate. We were randomly assigned and I got a reasonable roommate (F19). She was seeing this guy (M20) and I was fine with him spending the night sometimes. He seemed fine to be so I didn‚Äôt really care. Over the past few weeks he has been getting really upset/angry at something (usually something me or my roommate said) with not communication of why, being overall unhygienic, and overly blunt to the point of coming off as a bit rude. I‚Äôve been trying to let it slide since I‚Äôm typically not one for confrontation but it‚Äôs gotten to the point where sleepovers are a nightmare. Not to get to deep but I am a very traumatized person, so if I do not feel safe around someone sleeping/going to sleep I cannot sleep. I do not feel 100% safe around him and because of this it has made any time he spends the night my own personal hell, this lack of sleep on top of my pre-existing chronic illness has caused me to feel sick. But I don‚Äôt want him to feel like he‚Äôs not welcome/hurt my roommates feelings as he‚Äôs over what feels like a reasonable amount. But I don‚Äôt want this to mess with college. So tell me would I be the asshole?",

    "title": "AITA For getting mad at a game?",
    "selftext": "Hey Reddit this is something that has been on my mind and I feel like I need to share. I(24f) and Tay(23f) have been friends for almost 9 years. I was added to a friend group online by a friend that had her and 4 other people were in. Me and Tay hit it off outside the group and became best friends. I never had any close friends due to being bullied, so having someone I can see as a sister, made my life better. Tay tended to be bossy and when things didn‚Äôt go her way, there was a melt down. So to avoid any fights, I went along with her.The group slowly broke off due to a lot of issues but me and her stayed together. Over time I went to go visit her a couple of times and we had a blast everytime.  Then she found this game called phasaphobia. If you don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs like you have to go into different maps and find the type of ghost and leave. Well I got into it way more than her and played it when she wasn‚Äôt on. I started getting better equipment and leveling up fast. The next time we got on and she saw how much I played, she told me that she wants to only use her level equipment because if she used mine, she considered it cheating. I said it‚Äôs fine and it didn‚Äôt bother me because I didn‚Äôt have that much upgraded anyway.  Over time, I played it more and more and got way better at the game and can see the the higher the equipment, the better it was to find ghosts. I was at least at level 40 and she was still at only level 12. So the next time she decided to play, I told her,‚Äùhey I noticed the higher equipment makes things easier, why don‚Äôt we use my equipment since I have a lot of money to spend?‚Äù. She blew up saying that no it‚Äôs cheating and we need to do it with her equipment and that if we don‚Äôt then she won‚Äôt play.  I told her she‚Äôs getting worked up and that it‚Äôs not cheating that I wanted to use the higher equipment. She started saying I was disrespecting her boundaries and that I didn‚Äôt care how she felt. That resulted into a screaming argument and I told her that she needs to chill it‚Äôs just a game and that I‚Äôll talk to her in the morning once she calms down. She yelled saying if I hung up then it‚Äôs over and I told her fine and ended the call.  That was over a month ago, AITA?  Edit: I read what you guys said and that there‚Äôs a couple things isn‚Äôt wanted to say and also I didn‚Äôt say what was said in the argument because I didn‚Äôt know if Reddit had a limit or if my post would be taken down. I have only bought it up twice, so I always played it how she wanted to play it. The second time I was trying to tell her that the higher equipment was better and I had more money so was trying to help her level up. Also I just wanted her to at least try it once because I wanted to try it my way like how we play it her way. In the argument, i did try to compromise and I asked ‚Äúok we can use the lower equipment but can I at least use the level two spirit box because it‚Äôs always me using it?‚Äù. She refused saying that EVERYTHING needs to be level one and that it needs to be her way. I tried asking why couldn‚Äôt I use just one thing and she wouldn‚Äôt listen. This isn‚Äôt the first time we fought like this but that‚Äôs different stories",

    "selftext": "I (29f) grew up with and continue to make multiple friends from all different walks of life to the point where the movie ‚Äú27 Dresses‚Äù could be a biographical film of me in my 20s (minus the ending).   I love all of my friends so dearly and work so many hours that I never prioritized meeting the ‚Äúone‚Äù. Or at least never felt like I needed to prioritize a man when I have created such a good life for myself. I do however prioritize them.. my friends. I have traveled for weddings, birthdays, baby showers, you name it. And often times, at a great cost as I travel for work so am literally across the country compared to the majority of the girls but it didn‚Äôt matter because I love seeing them. Obviously, with that being said‚Ä¶ celebratory things like weddings and babies just don‚Äôt seem to be in my future (as sad as that makes me feel). However, I don‚Äôt fault people for choosing that path‚Ä¶ including my friend (30f) who got engaged last year.   Now to preface, after college/later in life, I met (let‚Äôs say) ‚ÄúSadie‚Äù by being a high school friend of one of my best friends. I love Sadie - she is so kind, funny, and I truly wish her the happiest married life. But I‚Äôm not actually in this wedding, and was invited to the bachelorette trip in the same group as I‚Äôm always in with a group of all of our close friends (who mostly all are in serious relationships / already having babies). The majority of them, however, are in the wedding.   Prior to Sadie scheduling her bachelorette date - I texted the group acknowledging I won‚Äôt really have many reasons to celebrate me like stated above. So I want to have a weekend for my 30th coming up and wished they‚Äôd all be there. The friend group has been best friends since high school and I joined them maybe less than 5 years ago. My birthday falls before a big holiday so I take that entire week off every year to travel home to take less PTO. However, I wanted to travel out of country/do a destination for this big milestone in my life. A week or so ago, we all FaceTimed and they agreed that those dates would be the perfect date for everyone to celebrate Sadie and to be completely honest, I agreed. She deserves to be celebrated, but a part of me feels like I do too. I didn‚Äôt mention how those days fell on my plans, or that I was unsure I was going to make it because of my birthday. I don‚Äôt think they were working in a hurtful way maybe they just forgot. I don‚Äôt blame them.   Is how I am feeling valid enough to schedule my trip (with some of the other walks if life I‚Äôve mentioned (my other best friends from high school, college, work, etc.) and just make sure I make Sadie‚Äôs wedding, or let go of the whole birthday celebration and celebrate Sadie? Am I wanting a village, but not wanting to be a villager?   TIA   - Jane from 27 Dresses",

    "selftext": "Hi, I‚Äôm [22 F] new to Reddit so please forgive me if my post is not up to Reddit standards. I wanted to ask if I am the asshole for telling my mother she should‚Äôve just stayed in California.   Basically, she went on a week and half long vacation with her fiancee and while she was gone, I took care of my three younger siblings who are 14,16, and 18. This means sending them to school and work outside of our usual driving to hang out and things of the sort. I don‚Äôt mind doing this, I love my siblings and although gas is expensive and I‚Äôm not really making that much money, I do what I can because I know there is no one else to help.   We had a really peaceful week; we all delegated tasks and knew what chores to do and yes they fought here and there, but it was actually really nice to have them both gone. I picked them both up from the airport tonight and I already knew it was going to be bad when we got home.   I will admit, I didn‚Äôt do some things my mother wanted me to do before she left (moving some of my new furniture downstairs into my room), but other than that, we kept the entire house clean and even cleaned and cooked before she came back to make sure when she came home it would be less stressful.   My mother and her fiancee ate dinner but I could tell she was already in a bad mood, which is understandable after a long flight, but when she got out of the shower and saw my little sister looking for her AirPods rather than being asleep (it was only 10:30 pm) she just kinda went off on us both. Talking about how she does too much for us and how she should‚Äôve just stayed in California and how we didn‚Äôt even clean the bathroom.   My younger sister told her that yes she should‚Äôve just stayed over there since she clearly doesn‚Äôt want to be here and I will admit I felt hurt, this isn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs done something like this after being away. I told her that the next she time she leaves to go on vacation or wherever she goes to just stay until she‚Äôs happy or just not come back at all because she always does this and it drags everyone‚Äôs mood down and that we did our best to keep the house clean and that I don‚Äôt know what it was she wanted from us but it doesn‚Äôt matter because she‚Äôs like this every time she comes back.  She didn‚Äôt say anything and now I am wondering if I am the asshole for saying those things?",

    "selftext": "AITA? Needing some opinions if I am in the wrong here. I have been divorced 3 years this November. My ex mother in law and I don‚Äôt really have a close relationship but we are always civil and I make sure my son stays very involved with her as a grandmother. My ex mother in law is a Realtor and I looked at homes with her in April but decided to wait and keep saving. Since then, I have been having issues with my ex husband (I started dating again in may and he‚Äôs livid) and so it has resulted in distancing myself from his family over the past 6 months due to their very vocal opinions of me dating again after 3 years of being single.  I started looking at home again for various agents and last week I reconnected with the builder (she introduced me to in April) and signed a contract on a home he‚Äôs building . My son was very involved in this and out of excitement let his dad know we are buying a house. Long story short, my ex mother in law found out and called the builder behind my back demanding to be added to the contract to get a commission (went on for 48 hours before I found out) The builder obviously could not do this because one, she was not physical there when the home was shown and she is not representing me. We never signed a buyer/rep agreement. She tried emailing one that was back dated but I refused to sign one, to me that is unethical and dishonest. I was very thankful she took the time back in April to show me 2 homes but we were in such a different place in our relationship and I also want to add she repeatedly told me she was going to waive her commission and put it toward closing costs. She harassed me for days over this and my ex husband withheld my child from me and we missed a paid for vacation last week to visit family (we have a decree but have never followed it) so since it was technically his time I lost out on the whole trip. I have been told they will no longer help me when needed etc etc. After not being to see or speak to my child for days, I called the builder and begged him to add her because of the drama it was causing which he declined to do so on ethics. As of today I backed out of the home, it was a week of emotional turmoil which I thought buying my first home as a single mother would be a happy time. It is. Is being spun by my exes entire family I did her wrong and karma will be paid back. AITA for not getting her back involved?",

I was attending to my son on the playground, he wanted me there, nearby, to take pics of his jumps.  He pointed out a specific swing there is only one of on the playground. Ppl were on it. We played on other things. I waited for it while he swang some more. It became available and I went to get it.  A younger girl met me at the swing doing the same thing. My son was just getting off the other swing l, so I told her, you go ahead, I'll get next.  Cut to 25 minutes later, and her and her cousins really seeming to enjoy watching me wait. No concern for my kid who is now plopped down, as we've now done everything else and still waiting.  My husband has also now been watching us wait while with our dog at a table.  Finally, the young girl I initially gave a turn to started to get off, so I go to grab it. She says, no,  we're not done. I say, ladies, we've waiting 25 minutes. They say another friend wants a turn, I say she needs to wait until my son and i were done. They flat out refuse.  I tell them, no really its our turn. And older cousin (all these girls are likely 10-17) starts yelling in my face saying I can't talk to them, their children etc. Finally their moms come over,  start yelling at me, repeating their daughters, that I'm talking to children, how dare I. I was stunned they flipped, totally ignoring their children were acting like little brats.  I just walked away at tjat point, they weren't going to hear my side that I was simply trying to be a village cause their children were not taking turns. I got in the car and bawled my eyes out.  Silver lining, my husband and son went back and my son got his turn.

Over this time, I(21F) had gotten closer with Melissa when we saw each other at family gatherings and such. Whenever we saw each other, it was always a good time. We have similar interests and senses of humor. They seemed like they were end-game despite them being very young. I guess i just assumed they were happy with each other and that wasn‚Äôt gonna change very easily. They even bought a house together and shared the mortgage. That‚Äôs why I felt it was set in stone. They came up with baby names, everything promising they could‚Äôve done.   Long story short, she broke up with him a month or two ago. I could give you all the details on both of their sides of the story if you want but I basically chalk it up to it just didn‚Äôt work out, and they were young and it‚Äôs okay that it didn‚Äôt work out. They both weren‚Äôt happy in the relationship because Bryan tended to be jealous and overthink. Melissa felt controlled by him. You know the classic situation where insecurity pushes two people apart from each other. Anyway, Bryan is very tore up about this and has confided in me when we hung out the other day. His siblings and parents have all alienated her from the family because they automatically took his side when they heard the news. Even sending Melissa hostile text messages telling her she ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù and even my aunt telling her to ‚Äúfuck right off‚Äù.   Messy, I know.  I‚Äôve been on the fence on whether or not it would be okay for me to hang out with Melissa, given the situation.

I can‚Äôt really figure out how to toe the line between the two.   Well tonight, I made plans to hang out with Melissa. We went to a pub in town and got food and some drinks. Bryan figured out that we were hanging out and texted me and asked if Melissa was at the bar tonight. I told him the truth about it and now he‚Äôs very upset with me. He said he could never hate me, but he would never do that to me. Saying I knew how depressed he‚Äôs been about it and he just didn‚Äôt expect that ‚Äúafter how horrible she‚Äôs been‚Äù.

    "selftext": "Posting this before I go to bed maybe regret it tomorrow morning anyway, for some context: I live in an Asian household and like the stereotypes my mom has always been a straight-A student and top of her school, my older sibling has always been praised for being super smart from a young age. Me? I struggle with school. I wasn't always like this, and my grades aren't bad, they're just not all As.   I've switched to online classes and so my mom said that I shouldn't have bad grades or missing work etc. I've been doing good so far, I've had some missing assignments here and there but end up turning them in late (but no late penalty) and my assignments are always in the range of 85%-100% but for some classes even with those percentages the total grade is like a D or C (It's a whole thing) I told my mom about it when she asked about my grades, she agreed it was strange.  One night after I when out with my friends she yelled at me for not turning in all of my assignments and etc same conversation from before. She kept switching what she was mad about every time I tried to explain myself. She told me no going out unless I turn in all of my assignments. I did all of my work and then I thought that was the end of it.  Since then, she would constantly ask about my grades. It gets on my nerves. She's been asking about literally nothing but school work, so obviously whenever she mentions school again I get a little agitated, but I don't want to get in trouble I don't say anything. When I get agitated I close my door a little too hard, or I walk a little too loud, and etc. So she would say \"why are you so mad?\" and \"I guess I won't tell you to do anything\" (Not exact words but I can't exactly translate it)  Today was when things sort of \"blew up\". Not sure how it even started but basically, my family (mom, dad, sibling) sat me down and said I need a better schedule/routine and etc. They told me things as if I could follow routines best fit for them, and maybe I could but it wouldn't be best for *me*. Later my mom and dad were talking and asked me why I was \"throwing a fit\" (not sure what they word they used is in English but that's close to it) and I said that I'm allowed to have emotions. Later my mom came into my room and asked why I'm mad at her, then I blew up. I told her, while sobbing, that I'm tired of her always talking about school and that I'm really trying my hardest, and that I can't take it whenever she talks about school. I told her that she hasn't talked to me about anything but school. She completely missed the point, she kept telling me that she has to so that my grades would be better. I honestly don't know what she was talking about because I was so shocked at her response. She ended the conversation with \"I'm too scared to even talk to you\" (another rough translation). Me and mom are super close, the post may not seem like it but it's true, I love her more than anyone. That's why I don't know what to do, so am I the asshole?",

I just have a feeling she is not happy here.   She has been peeing outside of her litter box for about two months. she chose the couch as her spot to pee, and now is peeing on our bed, too. We‚Äôve done nearly everything. Been to the vet multiple times, tested for UTIs etc, pheromone plug ins, pheromone collar, twice daily gabapentin, multiple calming supplements, CBD, extra play time, rotating toys, puzzle toys, feeding her in the spots she‚Äôs been peeing, clean litter box daily, etc. i‚Äôve even been extremely aware of my mood and the way i interact with her. speaking kindly and being patient and giving her positive reinforcement. she has a window hammock and tall cat tree and hiding places and scratching options. we even bought a whole new couch. We have even seen TWO different psychics/mediums. Our last option, per the vet, is to try prozac. will obviously try that.   but i am losing sleep over this and its causing so much stress, i am not comfortable in my home. we cant use our couch. we have to be monitoring her at most times which is difficult. not to mention all laundry and hundreds and hundreds of dollars this has cost us in such a short period which we can not sustain. we have travel plans at the end of the month, november, and december. i dont feel like we can leave her.   the cat clearly isn‚Äôt happy and idk what to do.

(He definitely knows that I like longer hair on him and he has accepted my opinion without any sort of trouble or fighting). A couple minutes later he asked me what I thought about his haircut. He can get very sensitive about his haircuts, so I made sure that I was able to give him my honest opinion without saying anything that could be misconstrued of taken the wrong way.  Finally I ended up telling him: \"It's not my favorite haircut but I think it looks good!\". At first he didn't take this the wrong way, we kept talking like we normally would. A couple of hours went by and he got extremely upset with me. He said that even if he asked me what my opinion was I shouldn't have told him that. He said that the only thing I got out of telling him I didn't love the haircut was hurting him, making him feel insecure, making him feel like he was ugly and like I didnt want to be with him. He even went to the extent of saying that I was gonna have to wait a couple of days to go out with him till the hair grew out because apparently I hated it that much (which is definitely not true). He said that I was making him feel like I didn't find him attractive anymore.  To a certain extent I do understand why he got upset, but I think that I was respectful and honest without being hurtful or mean. I love him and no matter the haircut he gets that will remain true.",

    "title": "AITA for not switching rooms?",
    "selftext": "Last year, I was placed with a random roommate (R1) in a very small double room. Her and I got along very well, and ultimately had no issues. Throughout the year, we met two other people (R2 and R3). These two each lived in separate suits with their own room. We were all paying the same price for first year housing.  We decided to room together this year in a 4 person, 3 bdrm apartment. There is a larger double room and 2 smaller single rooms. Originally, R1 and I were to share the double for first sem and for R2 and R3 to share second sem. It was important for R1 and I that we got it first semester, because we didn't want to have to go back to a double after adjusting to a single.  This summer, R2 and R3 lived together in the same room (same bed) for 2-4 nights a week. During this time, they offered (without us asking) to take the double for the entire year because they enjoyed living together, and naturally R1 and I agreed. At this point, we were all very close friends, and I acknowledge how naive this sounds.   A few weeks in to this sem, R1 and I realized, for a variety of reasons, that 4 people living together was too much for us. We communicated this to the other two girls and they were upset but ultimately fine. R2 also found and signed a lease with other people. R3 didn't have other plans, and felt like she was abandoned. R3 asked R1 and I if we could live together, but we gently informed her that we were already looking at 2 person apartments and she should probably try and find her own accommodations.   R3 became a distant, and I know she is really hurt that we aren't all living together next year. I'm sure she feels abandoned by the people she thought were her best friends. She's since found roommates for next year, and we interacted fairly normally if not a little distant until Sunday when she said she wants to switch rooms second semester. We had a meeting and she said she feels like she offered too much in making that agreement, she didn't like the double as much as she thought she would, and she was avoiding the dorm because she didn't feel like she has a place here.   Ultimately, R1 and I said no to switching because it's what was agreed to and the problems she has with the double are things that are known about doubles. I don't want to make excuses, but I have always had bad sleep anxiety, and I cope by making my sleeping environment a certain way. This is way easier to do in a single, and I had become settled with the idea that I would be staying there for the whole year -- this stability was really important to me.     I've been feeling very guilty. I'm usually empathetic and that's not how I acted in this situation. In principle, the room is mine, but emotionally I'm not acting like a good friend. I know her desire to switch is a result of her being hurt about next year, and I want to have a conversation about how we don't have to stop being friends, but I don't know if that will make it 'right'. So, AITA for not switching?",

    "selftext": "I (24F) work at a logistics company. I‚Äôve worked here since I was 21. My current position is CSR which requires a LOT of communication between departments to be able to triangulate/coordinate loads as efficiently as possible.   With that being said, the past year has been so annoying and uncomfortable to deal with. I began to notice that a lot of my coworkers will give me side eye/roll their eyes, stare me up and down, or just simply talk to me like shit when I approach them with work.  One thing about me is, I will not bother you unless there is work to do. I will not go out of my way to chit chat and whatnot so I think people get offended at the fact that I do not show them interest in that way. I will simply greet them, ask for their help with whatever task the client is requesting, and ask for an estimate of completion to pass to the client. I will, occasionally ask them if they‚Äôre okay if I see they‚Äôre sick, crying(especially the girls), or simply not their usual self. I know how that feels all too well since I went through chemotherapy 2 years ago and a lot of them saw me at my worst so I always try to look out for them in that way.  But I really hate how it all has become. A lot of them will say to my face ‚ÄúGet away. All you do is cause headaches.‚Äù Like bro, what? First of all, that‚Äôs hurtful to say to someone. Also, Im coming to you with work because we are, quite literally, AT work! We are getting PAID to do our jobs. I always ask them in a very kind, respectful, and professional way for them to say those snarky comments.  I also have been getting accused lately of sleeping around with these 2 guys at work that are around my age. They both have very important positions there at work and one can say they‚Äôre attractive in their own way but personally, HELL no. They‚Äôre both engaged (and Im a girls girl all the way) and we‚Äôre at work- I do NOT like to get involved with coworkers. Not to mention that they‚Äôre also not my type :) They both have told me of the advances a lot of the women there have made towards them but they flat out tell them no and draw boundaries with them over and over again. These 2 gentlemen often join my lunch table in the break room since we all get along and I‚Äôm one of the few that makes them feel comfortable since Im not throwing myself at them.   I have like 5 coworkers total(out of 100+ employees) that have actually become my friends and who I love dearly for their genuine friendship. I just know that some people dont know how to differentiate work and fucking around. I also grew up hearing my dad saying to always set a fine line between work relations and friendships. Point is: regardless if its because I dont want to be friends with the majority at work or if because I eat lunch with 2 people that the rest of the building wants to also eat with- I think that should be separated entirely. Like seriously, get over it and get to work.  AITA for thinking that?",

    "title": "WIBTA if I tell a friend tat I have too many problems with her birthday plan?",
    "selftext": "I(20F) have a friend (20F) whose birthday is coming up in 2 weeks. We live in a Dorm with strict rules(in-time and stuff), and she decided that she wants to stay out for her birthday+weekend, her birthday falls on a Friday so she is planning a full 3 day thing in the city. There are a few problems with it.  First one is that my parents are definitely not okay with this, she is asking me to lie to my parents about it and go along with her plan. Her point is I have gone out multiple times by lying to my parents, which is true but I have never stayed out all night, all of them were day things.   Evey time I try to bring up the fact that I am uncomfortable with the plan or I won't be able to join, she starts complaining that everything is wrong in her life and her birthday is also going to be ruined.   While we have other friends who are in on the plan, she will cancel her plans if I am not going, but I do not wish to lie to my parents about this. I am in a far away city for my uni, where they do not have people they know. They have entrusted me with my own safety and they trust that i follow the rules they have set for me. I do not wish to break that to such an extreme degree.  Second is, the plan is expensive, she is paying for some portion of it but I have to manage the rest myself. Her parents are giving her extra birthday cash, mine won't be giving me money for her birthday. My spending this year has already been quite high so I barely have much left and there is still more than a month before I can go home for Christmas break.  Third thing being her plan is to crash at a friends place, who is completely fine if not overjoyed by the idea. I am not fond of that person, it's not that i have a dislike to her it's just that i find that person extremely annoying. The point is she does too. She talks bad about her, makes fun of her, laughs when other people say something bad about her, but also invites her many times to hangout with us and stuff.   Recently the same thing happened and I feel bad for the girl as she always agrees to whatever because she doesn't have many people she could consider friends.  I do not know how to approach this anymore. The only way left is to tell her straight that i cannot join her in her plans even though it would mean she will have to cancel everything.   While I am sure my reasoning is good I know this will completely ruin her birthday. She has had a lot of problems she is facing recently so she will feel horrible about it.   I just need an opinion whether it is reasonable for me to go through with it or would I be the asshole if I did.  **TLDR**: My friend wants to have a 3 day celebration for her birthday as she is feeling down these days but due to my parents, money and people in the plan I do not wish to. But if I do not go it would mean she cancels the plan, WIBTA if I am the reason she doesn't celebrate her birthday.  **Additional Info I was told to add:**   My dorm will need permission from my parents if I am going out.    I come from a country where traditionally women were married off young and not sent out of homes for education.   So most dorm or such places are 'responsible' for the safety of the students staying there, so to make sure that if something happens to the student they aren't held solely responsible, they confirm with the parents that they know about the plan or whatever.  It is much lenient for guys, but for us we have strict rules we need to adhere to.",

    "selftext": "I moved in with my older brother(26) back in July. Before I even entertained the idea of moving in with him I made it very clear that I am a user of the devils lettuce. I told him that I would never smoke inside and I have stayed true on my word. He said he had no problems with it and so I moved in.    Today I went outside and smoked a joint that, admittedly, definitely had a stronger scent than I expected. I smoked it a solid two hours before he got off of work, thinking that the smell would be gone by then since it usually was. I never want to inconvenience him in any way so I tried doing it nice an early.   My bedroom is directly next to the back door, which we all use to get into the house (I always have a ton of fans on in my room for circulation and I was hoping that would help with the smell). And so he comes home and walks into the house and not even 10 seconds goes by and I hear this exaggerated gaging sound come from him. And then he just walked out of the house and he hasn‚Äôt been back in 3 hours.   He‚Äôs always been super passive aggressive and condescending about everything, but I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm actually the AH here since I‚Äôve never been in a situation like this.   EDIT: To clarify, I only smoke outside, my brother explicitly said it was okay as long as I didn‚Äôt do it indoors. I gave it 2 hours before he even got off of work. I shower daily and I wasn‚Äôt blowing smoke anywhere near the house, I stood out by the garage like I always do. I think it was just a strong strain and the smell lingered more than usual. I wasn‚Äôt trying to make anyone uncomfortable.  EDIT 2: we talked and he explained everything. So, he had a long day at work, he works at a middle school and some kid literally threw up on the floor so he was already having a bad day in general and he was super sensitive to smells. He told me that it‚Äôs literally never bothered him before and it was just a one time thing and he wasn‚Äôt actually mad because there was no way I was supposed to know he had a bad day.  Also the reason he left was because he was going to go play DnD with some friends and that‚Äôs why he was gone for 5 hours. I told him about the Reddit post and he laughed at everyone assuming that it was automatically a tie breaker for me to smoke given the fact that I literally told y‚Äôall that he said it was okay.  So, to all of the pot haters: you all can suck a dick and hopefully chill out a little.   -Stoner sibling OUT üôè",

    "selftext": "One of my best friends I‚Äôve known since grade 8 got with a boy in the beginning of June and didn‚Äôt tell any of us in the friend group  We are a very close knit friend group. She kept dismissing our hangouts and ghosting us during them, despite her planning most of them just to hang out with him.   Due to a strict family, she is not allowed to see him or any relationships. At my 18th birthday party, she forgot about a gift, the whole party and she showed up late and then left early to go see him after giving me a very rude card and 50 bucks in the card. (For reference, I had bought her a pandora bracelet with matching charms for her 17th.) Mind you she did not tell us about him and my grandpa had died from cancer two days prior.  During my party after she left, she called me and begged me to lie to her older sister, who was in my driveway about her whereabouts for her. She still hadn‚Äôt told me where she was (which was with him) and repeatedly refused to do so. I didn‚Äôt get to talk to her sister because the boy dropped her off before that.  Now, after a long summer of exhausting back-and-forth mixed apologies, mixed stories, and blaming it on him that he made her dump us, she wants me to go to her 18th and I calmly said no. She also broke up with him at the end of summer.  Two of the friends in our friend group are going the rest are still mad at her or still on the fence. Unfortunately and completely coincidentally we all booked tickets for a haunted house on the same day as her party , including the friends going to her party so they will have to leave 2 hours early to hang out with the people who denied to go to her party or ghosted her.  What should I do? Should I try forgiving her?  I understand her family is strict, but am still very hurt she used us and created hangouts just to never show up to see him.  I‚Äôm deeply hurt. Especially because of my 18th party and she wanted me to go to hers. AIO??  Please give me reasons and explain why I‚Äôm overreacting, or not. I‚Äôve been going crazy!",

I dont wanna just do fake family shit.  my step dads kids dont even talk to me when I go over, nor does his wife. didnt invite me to their wedding, and only say hi when I leave. I feel my parents value them more because they took the same path they did in life and mine differs from theirs.   AITA for not wanting to go over there?",

I like him and he was a friend of my dad's. Last year, my mom asked me to go to his family's christmas eve (it's like his cousins or something).   I know basically none of these people at this event). It was fine but I was just not that into it. She asked me today to do that again this year and I told her I'd rather just spend chirstmas eve alone.  My dog died this year and I also got divorced, so I don't really feel like being around a bunch of strangers on christmas eve. For the record, we are doing our own family things on Christmas day and then with our extended family on that Saturday and I'm staying at our house so there is plenty of time to see her.   My mom says I'm being an asshole for not being with her on that night.       AITA?   TL;DR: Mom wants me to spend chistmas eve with her new man's family and I'd rather not.",

    "selftext": "Okay so I(21F) and my sister(19F) have lived together for 2 years now. Recently I was fired and since housing was provided by my employer, i went homeless for a while. Thankfully she helped me through it and we both found a place to stay, and I really needed that since I‚Äôve found a job and she paid for the first two months as I was still waiting for my paycheck. We moved into an apartment that is shitty on its own, as it was extremely dirty and now we got cockroaches and mold in some places and we basically have to get this entire place to at least be decent on our own. Thing is my sister has a cleaning problem. Even when we shared a room she‚Äôd always throw her clothes everywhere around the room, she‚Äôd eat and leave everything in there, she‚Äôd never clean the house or the kitchen(and that created problems with the other people we lived with) but i‚Äôd always clean after her and make her bed whenever i‚Äôd do so. Thing is now that we‚Äôve moved i‚Äôd like to keep the place as clean as possible and i‚Äôm also willing to put a lot of work into it, but she‚Äôs not. and she gets angry and moody if i‚Äôm telling her to help me out with cleaning/renovating, and then stops talking to me. im not always gonna clean after her, even though id love to keep this place clean. She keeps saying that she doesn‚Äôt care but well, this is what we gotta do. And we can‚Äôt live like this. I refuse to live like this. I can feel my patience slipping away and turning into quiet rage and i‚Äôm just about to blow. I wish she‚Äôd do more. I wish she‚Äôd at least do SOMETHING. we lived in poverty and my parents neglected us and the house and that‚Äôs traumatic to me. The house is dirty = i don‚Äôt feel comfortable. seems like it has impacted us differently. i had a little fight with her and told her to stop putting her garbage and make up everywhere cause it just looks bad. I love her more than anything but i don‚Äôt want to live in a house that‚Äôs full of garbage. I avoid conflict because she did help me a lot but i still feel like this is the work that we both have to do in order to have a nice place. at the same time, maybe she‚Äôs got her own shit to deal with, and thinking about that makes me feel like im selfish for expecting things out of her after all that she‚Äôs been through just because i lost my job. (by the way i am giving her the rent money back, little by little) Am i the asshole? edit: added some details.",

    "selftext": "I live with 3 roommates, which 2 of them are in a relationship and living in a room together. Those roommates got a cat about half a year ago. They asked everyone else, including me, if we were alright with a cat present. We both agreed that they can adopt one.  They cared for the cat very well at first, taking care of her hygiene and whatnot, but with time they got more lazy and sloppy about it, especially in the litterbox department. In the kitchen (that we all share), stand all the trash bins. The bin for organic materials stands out in the open, since we have no other spot to place it. As you can expect, they started throwing the litter into the bin. Not in a bag, just from the litterbox, straight to the bin. It was incredibly rancid walking into the kitchen and catching a massive whiff of cat excrement. If the bin was not emptied quickly enough, the whole apartment would stink. I obviously brought it up to them, that it was bothersome. They agreed, and started throwing the litter out in small baggies.  It would be all well and good if not for the fact that it still stank, just not as much. With time i started getting bothered with the constant smell in the kitchen. Noone else seemed bothered by the smell, probably because they all lived with cats in their homes before we moved in. I decided to bring it up again. I explained that the smell is still there and it's really bothering me. They just kind of shrugged and brushed it off, as me being sensitive and the only one having a problem with it.  This is where I feel like I might've been the asshole. I walked into the apartment after a really hard week and immedietaly got hit with the same putrid smell. I looked down and the trash bag was pulled out of the bin and just left by the door. I decided that enough was enough. I placed the bag in their room and just left it there for them to come back to. After they came back, they were furious. They called me over to ask if it was me who left it there, which i agreed. I went on to explain that it's ridiculous that they're throwing the cat's litter into the bin yet again. They said that \"I agreed to the cat\". I replied \" The cat is not the problem, your incompetence and lack of compassion is!\". I went on to explain how I had to comform to their habits multiple times, while they consistently brush mine off. Moreover, I explained that they could just take the litter outside, which would take them at most 5 minutes each day and other solutions that really wouldn't be that extreme. They replied, and I kid you not, \"We can spend that time on more important stuff.\" and \"If you want us to do that, just throw the litter out with us\". Ultimately we came to the agreement that they will try something, like keeping the bags in their room.  AITA for leaving trashbags in my roommates room after repeat appeals of not throwing their cat's litter into the main trashbin?",

Her emotions got so bad one day, she outburst on this one guy for simply being extra competitive and jokingly shouting \"suck my di\\*\\*\" at the other team. Frau S whisked him into the hallway, started screaming and yelling at him to the point my friend in the class down the hall said they all stopped class to just listen at the free entertainment (lol). My actual teacher eventually had to go outside and calm her down after a good 10 minutes. Yeah, it was that bad. üòñ  A week later, we had an in class short test. In our class, its pretty typical for students to ask out loud \"How do I say....?\" or \"what is...?\". The guy in front of me raised his hand and asked \"how do we say 'to drive?'\", to which I simply said \"fahren.\" Frau S, super big for her britches, then walks over, takes my test, folds it up and throws it in the trash can in front of the whole class.

I moved in with him about a year ago.  During this time, I‚Äôve realized that his family has a lot of drama. He recently started talking with his sister after being on rocky terms for years. She was in an abusive relationship for seven years, and he didn‚Äôt talk to her for two of those years.  One day, she told him she felt like she didn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to. I offered to be there for her, because I‚Äôve been in abusive relationships myself and wanted her to know she‚Äôs not alone. He gave her my number, and I ended up having a phone conversation with her.  After that, she started calling me every other day to talk about her trauma and her abusive relationship. I suggested she get a therapist or an attorney for legal advice regarding her living situation, but she said she didn‚Äôt have the money. Later, she told me she had another boyfriend and had been traveling with him, but she was still technically living with her abusive ex. She also asked me to keep it a secret from my boyfriend.

It was me, my wife, our 1 year old, our dog, and my sister with her husband and their two kids who are 5 and 3. The house was big enough that her in laws stayed with us during the first week and our parents came in the second week.  Our dog is a rescue she is very sweet but gets nervous around new people. She knows both our families really well and loves the kids and my brother in law but she had never met his parents before. So we made it clear that she would always be leashed when they were around and that my wife or I would always be there.  Two days into the trip my sister‚Äôs MIL told me she is great with dogs and asked me if she could give her a treat. I said yes but I explained exactly how to do it safely. I told her to get down low so she would not tower over the dog and to move slowly. She said okay but immediately did the opposite. She leaned over her and reached down and the dog got scared and jumped up on her. I pulled the dog back right away and told her that for the rest of the week it would be better if she did not try to interact with the dog.  She seemed fine with that so I thought that was the end of it.  Two days later everyone else was out. It was just me, our baby, Sisters MIL+FIL and one of the older kids in the house. I was on the floor playing with my kid when I heard them talking very loudly at the dining table. It was that kind of loud where it feels like they actually want you to hear it. They were saying things like we will have to get it repaired when we get home and maybe we can find someone cheap to fix it.  I could not really ignore it so I asked what was broken and what needed fixing. She said that one of the kids had brought her her broken ankle bracelet. She said she was not sure what happened. Maybe it broke while she was on the trampoline or bumped into sonething, or maybe it was when the dog jumped at her earlier that week.  I said oh okay that sucks and left it at that. Nobody mentioned it again and the topic never came up once for the next 4 days that they stayed.  Fast forward two weeks after the vacation. My sister called me and said her in laws had a bracelet repaired and now they wanted me to send them 100 dollars for the repair.  I was honestly shocked. I called my sisters MIL right away and asked what that was about. She said she thought it must have been the dog when she jumped up on her. I reminded her that she ignored my clear instructions and that she was not even sure if it was the dog since she had mentioned several other reasons.  I told her that if she had talked to me honestly during the trip and said she thought my dog broke it I might have helped pay. But she said nothing, waited two weeks, and then sent the bill. So I told her no, I was not paying.  Now she is upset and told my sister I am an asshole So Reddit. AITA?",

    "selftext": "I'm from a country that doesn't speak English, and all... I'm writing from a different account, the names are in yours because my family has Reddit.  i'm Eleni, ( 25F) My story began when I was young.  I grew up in a large family, and when I say large, I mean literally large. My mom, dad, three half-sisters from my dad's deceased wife (Sophia, Tia, and Monica), me, my two younger sisters (Noah and Nia, the twins), my unmarried aunt, my two grandmothers, and my paternal grandfather. My large family of 12 members. None of them worked except my dad, mom, and aunt. Our financial situation is rubbish. I always felt that our financial situation would have been great if my dad had stopped spending so much money on his daughters from his first wife.  And when I say a lot of money, it really is. He buys them expensive things.  :- Clothing and Makeup I remember one time he bought Mony a dress for $250, while he refused to give me taxi money. Gifts for no reason.  When I complained to my grandfather about my father, he told me that my sisters didn't have a mother to care for them and that my father wanted to make up for it.  And that when my sisters grew up, they would work and the situation would end.  But that didn't happen because all three of them entered private universities near our house. My father wanted to buy them cars, and of course, our situation got much worse.  Noah and Nia only had two jackets for the winter, which they changed into as spare parts. As time went on, my sisters didn't work.  When I was 17, my father came to prepare me so I could start working at 18, pay rent, and contribute to the household expenses.  The strange thing is that my entire family agreed. I asked my father why his daughters didn't work. He told me I shouldn't compare myself to someone who doesn't have a mother. I told him that  My mother treated them like her own children; she probably pampered them more than we did.  Of course, I worked in a restaurant and at a bookstore. Noah and Nia grew up and went to different universities. Years passed, and I graduated, worked, and helped Noah and Nia.  Two weeks ago, I was at work. Nia called and said she was under my new house and needed someone to open the door for her. I went home, let her in, and we sat down. Suddenly, she told me that her father had kicked her out of the house because she refused to work. (For your information, Nia's field of study is difficult and requires focus, and it's hard for her to work while studying.) Mouni called and asked me to explain her mistake to Nia and let her work and pay her father's rent. I cursed Mouni and told her that she was selfish like her father and that she and her siblings were spoiled in our father's house. Of course, I was met with her famous crying spell.  Everyone called, even Sophie the Charismatic called and asked me how I could upset her sister.  And she thought there was no difference between us.  I told her that the difference between us was very clear",

    "selftext": "A year and a half ago I finally took the step because I had the funds to do so to move out of my parents house with my girlfriend. While I am not in love with the area, I do love her and have stuck to my promise of visiting frequently (I visit weekly or every other week and sleep over at least once a month).   When I originally moved out I was quite miserable living with my parents and often disappeared for days crashing at my girlfriend's or other peoples houses because I found them exhausting, which I think was just a by product of getting older and the issues that occurred. Obviously, no one (including my friends) were happy about me moving especially because of the location. There were a few reasons for this 1) I was always the person available for everything and always helping everyone 2) I was always the back up plan if things went wrong whether it was my car or otherwise 3) Most of my friends and family are quite poor and transportation is often difficult for them.  I tried to remedy that when I moved so they could visit me. Sometimes I would drive there and pick people up and bring them back. Most of them I would pay any tolls and gas it took to get there. I even cover some of their bills because I care and I know they're struggling. But since I moved I noticed there is always a tension and everyone is always lowkey kind of upset with me.  My brother has to move as him and his wife were having a kid and its only a little over 30 minutes for my parents to visit and he also complains I am too far. So, I also try as much as possible to visit him and my friends who have moved and my parents who are struggling financially but still everyone seems bitter about me moving.  To be honest, if I had a choice I maybe would move somewhere different or slightly closer but between work and better Healthcare (as I am also chronically ill and was in desperate need of better healthcare) the location I'm in works on a lot of levels. To be honest, it's just hard to keep up not only because it stresses me out that I could be a real asshole for moving and making them all upset at me but also because my health is getting worse and it feels like everyone is even more frusterated with me because I can't travel as much as I'd like to to hang out and see everyone. Hell, even if I wasn't as sick I still would have difficulties seeing everyone since I work 40-60 hours a week depending on what is going on. I could go on, I just need to know...am I the asshole? If I am how do I be better and not as shitty as a friend and family member?",

    "title": "AITA for asking my coworker not to whistle so much?",
    "selftext": "Throwaway etc.  I (31NB) work in a small building with an even smaller team, most of whom are neurodivergent in some way (several with ADHD, I'm the only one who's also autistic). The work environment is very casual and none of of our roles are customer-facing. I've been here three years and it's been more or less smooth sailing.  However, due to my disability I have a lot of sensory sensitivities that require a fair amount of management on a daily basis. Both my manager and supervisor (both 40sF) are aware of this and have said to let them know if I have any accommodation requests at any point. I haven't yet because I prefer to deal with it myself, so at most I'll wear a pair of Loop earplugs or take a couple of quick sensory breaks throughout the day. This has been fine so far and hasn't affected my ability to do my job at all.  Recently though, there's been one particular sound I've found especially unpleasant - my supervisor's whistling. It's something she's always done, usually when she's concentrating or working hard, and I've always just tried to tune it out. But it's been getting more and more frequent, so that now she's doing it a solid 80-90% of the time. It's often louder than the background music we have playing and usually not in tune with it either, and it's not just when she's really concentrating - it's when she's just working, or bored, or thinking, or even during meetings when someone else is speaking. Because of the nature of our roles I can't request to work elsewhere in the building, which would be the easiest solution, and Loops actually made it worse because they muffled the background music so much that the whistling became the salient sound and was even more overstimulating. I tried taking extra breaks to self-regulate, but that was disruptive to the workflow to the point that the person I was working with the other day kept asking if I was okay because I had to keep stepping out.  So I decided to bite the bullet yesterday and talk to my supervisor. I made it clear this was a situation of conflicting access needs and nobody was in the wrong, and that I was hoping we could find some kind of compromise like maybe she could hum or sing instead, or whistle more quietly/less often. She implied it was weird that I was \"tracking\" her whistling because she's \"always done it this much\" and \"doesn't even notice she's doing it\", then asked if I could do something on my end to deal with it. I told her what I'd already tried and said I was very open to any suggestions she might have for anything else I could try. She didn't offer any, and just ended the conversation kind of abruptly by saying she would \"try\" to whistle less. The vibe was definitely off after that and it's clear she's ticked off about the whole thing, so I'm looking for some outside opinions on the situation.  AITA for asking her to change her behaviour due to my my sensory distress? Or is she TA for not being more mindful of making so much noise in a shared space?",

Diagnosed with adhd last year which was hard to come to terms with, rough &amp; busy year, trying to save for a wedding, struggling with people pleasing and have done for as long as I can remember.\r \r Fiance (36M) and I (36F) agreed last spring when we got engaged that we wanted a child-free wedding. Was worried about family opinions but all was well as of this summer as I messaged my family with kids to say we had picked our venue and that the wedding will be adults only. People were fine, no issues there. Fast forward 5 months, family circumstances have changed.. someone in my family is now expecting their 2nd child who will be 5 months old by the time we get married, would be classed as an automatic exception usually as a breastfed baby under 1 year.\r fiance is away from home when I found out about the new baby so planned to tell him when he returns (he is away for 2 weeks &amp; we had separate guestlist quarrel few weeks prior also). However, he messaged a couple days ago &amp; said his cousin cant come to the wedding (5 hr drive) without her toddler &amp; suggested we make an exception for her. He's very impulsive. In my poor mental state where I'm on edge &amp; dealing with worry, I agreed as felt it would make it easier for me to mention the exception for the new baby in my family with no pushback. He thinks its all agreed &amp; fine but ive been on edge since.. mainly around making 2 exceptions  where other family members may feel this is unfair. Called my mother for some advice as the worry has been eating away at me. She said I need to speak to fiance when he's back but he‚Äôs the one who opened the floodgate by pushing for an exception for his cousin's toddler. my mother also said it's unfair to allow the 5 month old baby but not allow the baby‚Äôs older sibling to come along- said its forcing the parents to split up their kids. My mother said \"children wont ruin your wedding though\".. i told her i dont hate kids, but didnt picture my wedding with 10 kids there. She assured me if I change plans and include them all, it will be fine but im doubtful.. ive seen these same children at weddings/parties running around wildly, getting injured, dominating dance floors, &amp; parents who cant be bothered to keep them in check. Its just not what I want &amp; I feel like I have to tell my fiance he‚Äôs made it incredibly difficult for me by pushing for this exception for his cousin and explain how I felt pressured, and then either suggest we include all the other kids, or tell him if his cousin cant make it without her toddler then tough, she‚Äôll have to stay home ‚Äì we aren‚Äôt responsible for managing other people's disappointment. Think at the moment he probably feels this is all sorted but its not him who has to deal with the inevitable backlash from my family.

AITA if I let her figure it out on her own?   My Mom is currently looking into hip surgery, and trying to figure out how life looks for her going forward &amp; expects me to \"help\". We will be talking later today so I'd like to be prepared to tell her no, and not sure if I should be upfront with my perspective on this ask and our relationship, or if I'm being shortsighted and should suck it up since she's my mom. She's 63 &amp; retired 15 years ago, pursuing instead a soap &amp; reselling business that has kept her afloat since then, as she never saved for retirement. She lives in a small studio &amp; has a car but not much else to her name. She collects social security &amp; all other income goes unreported. Since she \"works for herself\", she is free to come and go and do as she pleases with the money she does make - over the past 10 years she has traveled to I think 4 different countries, she's regularly buying random herbal supplements &amp; generally lives \"in the moment.\"    I see all of this as being extremely irresponsible, something she has been honestly my whole life. She's now looking at a surgery that will confine her to her studio for at least 4 weeks healing time, unable to make money, most likely by herself if I can't be there (she cuts relationship ties at the smallest slights, doesn't have many local friends).   We currently have a \"pretty good\" relationship, because I have physical distance from her and have forgiven her for her mistakes in my childhood, for my own mental health. I have a sibling that is no contact with her for these same mistakes. I truly believe she has made her bed and as it is, now has to lay in it.  I do know when we talk later shes going to ask me to come help her, and I don't know how to approach saying no, or if I should say no.  She was always a selfish and neglectful parent, and when it was her turn to care for me she did the bare minimum (all of 2 years as a teenager, didn't even make it to 18). I feel like I want to tell her exactly that, and make it clear to her she has never taken accountability for anything, she put herself in the position of having no money or resources so she could galavant the world. On the other hand I also feel some amount of responsibility for the woman who birthed me, a woman who had a hard and traumatizing life as well - but don't have the resources to help in any real capacity. I don't have money to throw at the problem, I don't want to use all my time off for the year taking care of her, and I wouldn't get paid if I take leave, which I won't even qualify to take until another 6 months from now.  Reddit AITA for holding her accountable/responsible for putting herself in this position? AITA for putting myself first here?   Edit: Thanks everyone for your perspectives, even those that think I may be the asshole - there's valuable information in some of those too. I really appreciate all the resources and ideas for how to empower her to help herself, since it won't be me. While this is currently about the hip surgery, the future looms and alot of my concern is for then too. She won't live happy and healthy forever, and I love her, but I do know she has put herself in this position and I don't have the material or emotional resources to be a caretaker. I recently did the caretaking thing for my dog, who I loved with my whole being, and it still wore me down to my bones. I can't do that for someone who I still have resentment for.   And I want to touch on something I saw come up, forgiveness. I have forgiven her and others that wronged me, as I recognize \"hurt people hurt people\" and everyone that neglected or abused me had their own extremely painful past. There is still space to feel resentment after forgiveness, and I have a duty to protect myself from putting myself in positions to be hurt further. I've gone back and forth on going no contact with her myself, but the forgiveness has allowed me to communicate with and love her from a distance - a distance she attempts to close with emotional manipulation occasionally, but I have and plan to stay strong in holding this boundary.   I'll be researching what I can from my peaceful home 3 states away, help where I can, but won't be setting myself on fire. Thank you again everyone!",

My family‚Äôs fortunate to have enough money for a nanny, my mom is often away at work and I have school and a part time job both so I don‚Äôt have all day to look after my siblings. Their old nanny quit last month due to an injury and we hired a new one around two weeks ago, she lives with us, gets the weekend off. Her only job is to look after them and keep them safe. I help out a lot whenever I can, mostly with putting them to sleep and getting them to eat. The thing is, although she‚Äôs experienced and has been a nanny before, she‚Äôs not very good with the kids. She‚Äôs on her phone a LOT, brushes them off when they wanna play and she‚Äôs totally hopeless with putting them into bed. Which is like totally fine, I don‚Äôt mind helping but she doesn‚Äôt bother trying anymore, just knocks on my door and says she can‚Äôt get them to sleep two minutes in.   So that brings us to yesterday. Like I‚Äôve said before, her only job is the kids, right? She‚Äôs cleaned up, or at least attempted to, multiple times. Me and my mom both have told her at least five times that we appreciate it but to leave the cleaning to me, we prefer it that way. I was studying in my room last night and then I heard like this loud thud, then my sister screaming. So obviously I run over to see what‚Äôs going on and find she fell off the TABLE and busted her lip. Obviously I‚Äôm livid dude. The nanny is in the same room with a broom. I help my sister first and after she‚Äôd calmed, again, told her that no one has asked her to clean. The fact my sister managed to climb onto the table, play on it and fall off all while she‚Äôs in the same room is actually ridiculous since she should be looking after her. She didn‚Äôt say anything to me but later complained to my mom apparently that she doesn‚Äôt appreciate a teenager constantly scolding her. She said it‚Äôs misreading and embarrassing and that I‚Äôm making it hard for her to be comfortable in the house. So now I‚Äôm just like ???what?? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done anything wrong, I didn‚Äôt yell at her either.

I realized I forgot to specify which meat we wanted right after I sent it, but I figured if it came back turkey instead of chicken it would be fine and wouldn't be worth bothering the downstairs staffer to try getting corrected at that point. What arrived for those four people was sandwiches that contained only bacon, lettuce, and tomato. The amount of bacon was just two strips. I thought it would be common sense that they would include a more satiating meat and should have replied to make sure that was right. Everyone in the meeting acted like this was my fault. I'm thinking of asking the downstairs secretary why she didn't reply back before **ordering 4 all-condiment sandwiches.** AITA here?",

    "title": "AITA for choosing a stronger group over my friends for university projects?",
    "selftext": "Basically its the start of second year at university and many professors told us that we need to group up to 3 ppl because of the future projects we will have. In my friend group we are 5 ppl where we hung out alot in the first year of university and helped each other alot. In this group 2 ppl are really smart in the field, I gained alot of knowledge in a year while one has more experience than me but just isnt clicking that well in the field and the final one has a full time job and barely has free time outside of university. When it came time to choosing groups i chose along side them to team up with 2 who are very smart in the field because i knew the semester would go way more smoother with them, but when we told the other 2 about it they got mad and said that we abandoned them and that I specifically should join their group to help them. I refused and stated my reasons and that while i would be in their help, id rather pass this semester easier and better. Now i feel really bad about what i said but at the same time I agree with myself about my decisions because i know if I go into the same group as them ill have to carry them alot and while im better in this field now than i was, Im still not good enough to know how to do every project to even help myself let alone them. So reddit AITA of the way i reacted or is there smth else i couldve done?",

    "title": "AITA Dog peeing on new tree",
    "selftext": "I usually walk 1-2 miles with my dog in varying routes around my neighborhood. I wave to people, and usually have my ear buds in to catch a podcast or something.   Today I took my dog on a walk and we went by a duplex where someone was constructing something out front. I didn't think anything of it. It's a corner lot so we took the side street and my dog wandered into their yard and peed on one of the trees. It was a fairly small tree. Again, I didn't think anything of it we just kept going.   Out of the corner of my eye I see the person who was construction something saying something to me. I turned around and took out my ear bud and he's in my business about the fact that he just planted that tree. I get it. I probably would be upset too. I told him I didn't know it was just planted and I apologized, but he wasn't letting up. He just kept saying \"I just planted that true and your dog peed all over it.\" I started realizing that this wasn't going to go anywhere so I asked him what he wanted me to do about it.   He said he wantedmw to pour water on the tree and wash the leaves off. At this point I almost face palmed. Not wanting to make any enemies I asked him if he had a hose or something I'd spray the tree. He said he doesn't live there and that I should go back home and bring water.   At that point I had had it with the conversation. I said I'm sorry I can't help. He went and pulled out his phone and took a picture of me and said I'm just taking this in case someone needs to be blamed if the tree dies.   I just walked away. I half considered driving back with a gallon of water or something, but then I was afraid hed take a picture of my vehicle or license plate and do something with it. So I just finished my walk, went home and got about my business. I didn't say anything mean, and felt like I was being more accommodating that I should have been. I understand the perspective of the contractor, but dogs gonna pee on plants. AITA?",

    "title": "AITA for not wanting my Roomate's Girl over all the time?",
    "selftext": "Ever since the start of this year's school year I have lived with 2 roomates and we all go to Purdue. One being single and one being in a relationship, we will call him Jude. (Context: Jude's girlfriend was somewhat friends with me before they started dating). Jude has had this girlfriend for about 8 months or forever it seems and she is over quite a lot. By that I mean she is basically living there as well. She does have a house she can stay at and is paying rent at and she does NOT go to college where we go. She has showered a couple times at our house but besides that she basically lives there and calls it her \"home\". She is at my house more than I am at the house (I do work part-time). She will be there a lot of times when nobody is there. There has been times where I come home and she is the only one there and she is working in the living room. She is working a full time remote/in person job. She has set up an extra monitor in our \"work area\" and that is where she does a lot of work when she is remote and sometimes does it in the common area. I feel as if she may be there too much. She does do dishes and cleans sometimes, however, nobody asks her to do it. She has on 3-4 different occasions asked me to do different things like \"can you do the dishes\" or \"can you clean up that\". AITA for saying that she is there too much? or is it even worth it at this point? We have had more than one person (that are our friends that come over sometime) that have said that \"she has more say in the house than you guys do\" ((referring to me and my other roomate (not Jude)). AITA for bringing this up and saying something?",

    "title": "AITA for speaking up!",
    "selftext": "Let‚Äôs start from the beginning. I joined the family back in 2018/2019. I instantly noticed the dynamic in the house was different. It was a 3 bedroom home with 8 people living there including  2 toddlers. The initial plan was my brother in law and his family were staying till they get back on there feet‚Ä¶ 8 years later and here we are still same position. So recently a lot of lies have been brought to the family‚Äôs attention about him and his wife. Stating they are taking care of the bills that are in my mother in laws name however every-bill is on pink‚Ä¶ his 2 nieces ‚Äúroom‚Äù is really the daylight room with a massive 6ft window.  Now let‚Äôs get to the AITA. Recently my mother in law has been venting to us about how she feels the strain from taking care of the girls because she the one who feeds them, bathe them, takes care of them when sick. I told her son my husband we needed to say something. We then found out his brother lied about going on a work trip and really took a paid vaca ‚Äúby himself‚Äù. Two weeks later his wife took vaca ‚Äúby herself‚Äù. We confronted his brother and told him how this was not right and I said a lot more details about things I knew about like the coworker he was cheating on his wife with‚Ä¶ I believe she is cheating as well bc once she found out nothing was done at all.   Well yesterday my mother in law called us to see if we could babysit the girls bc they ‚Äúgot sick‚Äù and were dropped off at the house even tho grandma and grandpa had plans.   We sent them a text asking why one of them could not take off a couple of hours to watch the girls. They both proceeded to claim they couldn‚Äôt bc the vaca they individually took. I told them it sounded like a personal problem but that this was not okay bc they just ruined the grandparents plans. They both called grandma and got mad at her for calling us bc it was ‚Äúnot our concern‚Äù. We then told them it was bc mom called and then they changed tunes saying ‚Äúshe misunderstood and miscommunicated to y‚Äôall what‚Äôs happening‚Äù. We said there no miscommunication y‚Äôall did a drop off with out actually asking then they both called individually saying they were on the way home and it‚Äôs under control. I said it‚Äôs under control because we said something but what‚Äôs y‚Äôall plan so we know if we need to go. Sister in law says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the way home right now‚Äù. She picked up the girls at 1:30 went back to work till 3:30 and claimed she was getting off at 4:30. If she got off early after we said something why not that be the initial plan. So they both said ‚Äúthanks for y‚Äôall concern and since watching the girls is such a big inconvenience we will never ask y‚Äôall for help again‚Äù mind you they have never asked us for help they always just leave and expect grandma and grandpa to watch.   GMA and gpa are so scared to say something because they have taken the girls away before from there other grandparents when they lived with them bc they didn‚Äôt get there way.   AITA for saying something.  Ps. They are both managers at the place they work for and grandparents are 75 &amp;78 years old. This is also our first time saying something in the past 6/7 years, we do not live there and haven‚Äôt since they moved in.",

    "selftext": "So today I took my kids to get their shots, offered because alot of times my wife struggles to sleep. So she can sleepin a bit . This gives her time to get ready and once im done I meet her and she gets one of the kids and take to school and I take the other (divide and conquer). In the past I usually go to the cafeteria (Army hospital) after the shots to get food for lunch for myself and whatever the kids want. I usually call my wife to ask if she wants anything and every time she says no. Today I failed to call to ask and she goes off on me as to why I didnt call her to ask and that she would have wanted a sandwich. Now shes telling me cusing me out and dropping f bombs. I did apologize and admitted I failed to call her and she continued and to not call her for the rest of the day. Naturally I got upset too because here im focusing on trying to take care of the kids, I even offered to take one of the kids to school because she was going to take both (we both work and i was late in). I know im wrong to some extent but is she overreacting? Am I the asshole?",
