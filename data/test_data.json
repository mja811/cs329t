When I came home my friends came over the next day, I acted with respect, I thought, only cuddling into my partner watching a movie and one kiss when they got me a drink. But I got a message from the friend the next day saying ‚Äúthe pda made me sooooo uncomfortable please stop üôè‚Äù  Now I feel like a jerk. But it was in our own home and usually we are really touchy with each other. Not sexually just always touching n caressing out of love.  How do I rectify this with my friend.  Hopefully this reads well I‚Äôm super drained from long hospital stays. More info can be given if required",

    "selftext": "My sister (21F) and I (21M) are twins. My sister‚Äôs boyfriend (23M) is trying to plan something special for her birthday. He has asked me to help out with it. Originally I said sure, but then he proceeded to send me a list of people to contact to send a video of their favorite memory with her. Some of these people were my childhood friends who he mistook for her‚Äôs. It was a list of 20 something people and he sent the list to my parents as well. My mom called me and said that she and dad handled everything with the list and not to worry about it.   He texted me a week after sending the list and asked how much of it I accomplished. I told him that mom and dad handled everything on the list but he said that they got a different list and that I had to reach out her favorite professors and get them to make a video. We do not go to the same schools and even if we did, I just think that‚Äôs weird. I just decided to tell him that it‚Äôs okay because our parents are probably doing something for our birthday anyway. (Trying to drop a hint in case he may not know we‚Äôre twins).   He then said that he thinks it‚Äôs incredibly rude and disrespectful to not help out during my sister‚Äôs birthday. I then just flat out told him that we are twins and we don‚Äôt do things like this for each other‚Äôs birthdays. And that it‚Äôs just weird that he wants me to be so heavily involved in this plan. He just left me on read and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I hurt his feelings (he‚Äôs sort of sensitive) or if he didn‚Äôt know what to say because he didn‚Äôt clock that we were twins. AITA?",

    "title": "AITA For Not Wanting to Join a College Sorority Out of Spite",
    "selftext": "My mom has this unshakeable belief that I have no friends, and I would rather be cooped up in my room doing school work and hobbies. She thinks that if I join a sorority, I‚Äôll make some lasting friendships and it‚Äôll solve all of my ‚Äúproblems.‚Äù She was in a sorority herself, so her logic is ‚Äúsince I had a good experience, Red will too.‚Äù  Originally, I wasn‚Äôt really bothered by her pressuring. My college does deferred rush, meaning that the rushing for sororities happens in the spring and not the fall. That way, we get time to go to sorority events and get to know the houses. I thought, ‚Äúok, I‚Äôll hear her out and try the events to see if I like it.‚Äù  I ultimately ended up feeling that the experience was not for me, and I have expressed this numerous times to my mom. Every time I express this, she thinks up some excuse to dispel my argument like ‚Äúyou have a preconceived notion about the girls in it‚Äù or ‚Äúyou just haven‚Äôt done enough.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt matter how I think or feel, she must find a way to discount it.  It‚Äôs gotten to the point where just because I won‚Äôt commit to a sorority, I am ‚Äúmaking her depressed.‚Äù I have experienced so many arguments, yelling, and tears and just ‚Äúthis is hurting me!‚Äù It‚Äôs become all about herself. Doing well in classes? It doesn‚Äôt matter; I‚Äôm not doing enough for sororities. I joined this cool club? A club is nothing; sororities are better. If I go home she wants to strike up a conversation about sororities, nothing else. It feels like all of my value here in college comes down to this one thing. It‚Äôs making me feel trapped and it‚Äôs degrading on my mental health.  She‚Äôs even gone the extra mile to share my Instagram with people I don‚Äôt know, and give my phone number to another person, whom I also don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm not on social media a lot, so this made me very uncomfortable.  I had a professor notice the shift in my mood, so she asked me what was troubling me and I explained this to her. Everyone, including her, that I have explained my situation to has said something along the lines of ‚Äúit‚Äôs not for everyone, it‚Äôs ok if you don‚Äôt want to do it.‚Äù Even my dad encourages me to do what I want. It is only her.  I‚Äôve reached my limit, and I‚Äôm at the point where, come this spring, I‚Äôm considering not even rushing, not just because I don‚Äôt like it, but out of spite. If she wants to make me feel bad about myself because I won‚Äôt join a sorority, fine;  I‚Äôll make sure she knows that type of behavior will not get me to do it. It saddens me because what could‚Äôve been this fun cool thing now feels like a burden to me. I go to a sorority event and I just feel this deep sadness; it sucks. If I cave and actually join a sorority, I‚Äôm just letting her win, and it encourages her to behave like this again when she can‚Äôt get me to do something she wants.  I want to make a note: I‚Äôm sure she does this from a place of love, it‚Äôs just hurting me.  AITA for doing this out of spite?",

    "title": "AITA for \"not telling\" my friend stuff?",
    "selftext": "For context, I'm currently studying abroad in university and I'm on my second year. I met this person within the first few days of the semester and we got close ever since. We're from the same major, which kinda helped with getting closer since we were in the same class.  This semester, we got some new friends. These people are more of the party type, but my friend barely drinks. (We'll call them Oliver to make it easier.) We've invited Oliver to join us for drinks but they refused because: (1) They're not gonna drink. (2) They want to call their partner at nighttime. (3) They don't want to waste money, even for food.   Everything seemed fine up till we (new friend gruop)started hanging out more. Me and Oliver would talk a lot about what went down between people back then (last semester,) mostly funny incidents that happened when we were intoxicated. But this time around was different. We had a new friend group, not just random people that changes every weekend. There were secrets involved, group chats, and (planned) trips.  Now that there's a group chat without Oliver, I can't help but to feel bad, as if I've never invited them to these gatherings. Oliver has also made it clear that even if it is free, they'll never join us because of their partner. Not because their partner is restricting them, but because they mainly call at night. This is another issue that I have with Oliver. (I'll call Oliver's partner Jake.)   Everytime we go out for food, Jake would call. It's not just a quick call, it can last up to 30 minutes and they'd do that repeatedly. I've tried telling Oliver that it makes me feel like they're not valuing my time since we both have busy schedules. Oliver would apologize but wouldn't do anything about it. I tried asking my friend on what I should do in this situation, but they told me that I've done enough and that Oliver should acknowledge what I said properly. It hasn't always been this way, Oliver used to be such a good friend before they got into this said relationship.   Back to the issue, Oliver has never once wanted to join us, yet they always ask me about the tea that happened while we were drunk. I didn't tell them anything. I'd feel horrible for telling them other people's secrets. After telling them that I won't be doing that anymkre they said, \"Oh so that's how it is now.\" I'm not sure whether that's in a good/bad context. I tried telling them that if they join our gatherings, then maybe we'll tell Oliver about our drunk stories. Not sure if it'll actually happen, but based on their reaction, it seemed like a no.   But now my concern is that Oliver will find out about the other plans and feel offended that they're not 'invited.' I feel like a terrible friend",

    "title": "WIBTA for reporting my old teacher and potentially ruining his career",
    "selftext": "Context: I was in marching band in high school, now I‚Äôm a college freshman. We had a new director come in my sophomore year and he was great. But he was really weird with one of the seniors, Britt, that year, she was always in his office getting almost a therapy session from him and he also confided in her about some really personal things in his life. Everyone thought this was really weird.  Fast forward to my junior year, I‚Äôm in the position that Britt was in before she graduated and the director makes it clear he doesn‚Äôt like me and wants me to be just like Britt was but I just can‚Äôt. This same idea continues into my senior year. He never takes me seriously with my ideas or feedback, because I‚Äôm not Britt. (My personality is completely different from her and I look actually the exact opposite of her)  During this whole time there‚Äôs another student Cass. Cass is a year younger than me and is kinda similar to Britt. They look a little alike and are talented, extroverted musicians. (Long blonde hair, blue eyes, pretty petite) I watched for two years, and for two years our director slowly tried to make Cass into Britt. Now after I graduated Cass is in the same spot Britt and I were.  Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm conflicted. I watched for 2 years how he completely changed cass‚Äôs identity into Britt‚Äôs. Nothing physical ever happened between any of them, if it did then it would‚Äôve for sure been reported. He just had a weird emotional attachment to Britt. She‚Äôd talk about her relationship issues with him and he‚Äôd talk about how stressed he was and his marital issues with her. As for Cass, she didn‚Äôt let him get as close but he‚Äôs still managed to mold her almost into a clone of Britt in the way they act and conduct themselves. The whole codependency thing did not happen with them. But she doesn‚Äôt exactly shut down his attempts. She‚Äôll still listen to him but doesn‚Äôt reciprocate by opening up to him too.  Is this grooming? I posted this in a different context to a different subreddit and someone commented that it is and I need to make a police report. Is this the right move? And if I don‚Äôt report it to the police, would reporting it to the school district be the right call? Would I ruin a man‚Äôs career over this? Or do I keep my mouth shut?  I‚Äôm very torn on what to do or if I should do anything at all.  Edit: after writing this and thinking about it I remember another band senior the same age as Britt who‚Äôs named Sarah also had this kind of relationship with the director. He‚Äôd have her in his office and talk about their emotional issues.  And here‚Äôs what the therapy sessions were like -at least 30 minutes  -in his office with the door closed -both Sarah and Britt were always alone with him when they talked",

There was a girl in the class that shares my dead name but we have incredibly different last names and different handwriting, but Z tried to hand me the other girl's paper, this is how the conversation went:  Me: \"no this isn't my paper, that's A's paper\" Z: \"your name is A.\" Me: \"no it's not, to family it is, to you it's not, you can call me that during get togethers but not in school.\"  Z put the paper on the correct desk but I still told my teacher because I'm too old to be a baby about it, I thought that was it. No.  Z apparently snitched to M, M called my aunt and told her to get T to call my dad and get me in check. (Ow.)  Obviously my dad said no by the way, but AITA?

    "selftext": "Me (21F) and my friends, who I‚Äôll call ‚ÄúMuriel‚Äù (22F) and ‚ÄúLisbon‚Äù (21F), took an Uber to go out this weekend.  As soon as we got in the car, our Uber driver (late 30s) launched into a tirade about how his life is basically falling apart. For half an hour, he used us as a captive audience to rant about his marital and career failures. He bragged that he was making $200K in tech previously, but got laid off, and now his wife wants to leave him. Then he starting kicking off about his wife and ‚Äúhow could she abandon him for no reason in his time of need after 15 years of marriage‚Äù and saying she‚Äôs going to take their kids. He said he‚Äôs only going to be an Uber driver for a short time to network and get back into tech, and because of ‚Äúinteresting conversations like these.‚Äù  The conversation turned to us girls, and he started interrogating us about our majors and how old we are. He said he studied computer science back in the day. Muriel told him she‚Äôs majoring in history, and he remarked ‚Äúok, so just put the fries in the bag.‚Äù I said I‚Äôm majoring in women, gender, and sexuality. He interrupts me saying ‚Äúanother worthless major.‚Äù So that was the end of civility.  I said there‚Äôs no such thing as a worthless major, as the point is to learn critical thinking, and my major is actually one of the most important ones, since the oppression of women is one of society‚Äôs greatest problems that must be solved. And I said ‚Äúmaybe if you had taken a course in women, gender, and sexuality in college, your wife wouldn‚Äôt be leaving you.‚Äù  He said I don‚Äôt know anything about the real world, and I‚Äôll never get a job outside of fast food. I told him the fact that I already got a six-figure return offer from a fast-growing tech startup, which I secured no problem through networking with my sorority alums. Muriel interjected that she also has a return offer with a top investment bank to which our college is a feeder.   I commented that it seems like the only person who doesn‚Äôt know anything about the world is him, and maybe he‚Äôd have a decent job still if he didn‚Äôt pick a useless major like CS.  We reached the event venue at this point, and he told us to ‚Äúget the hell out of his car.‚Äù I sarcastically wished him luck with his divorce.  Lisbon, who‚Äôs not confrontational and was quiet most of the ride, said Muriel and I were ‚Äúso aggro for no reason‚Äù and embarrassed her because we can‚Äôt take a joke. And that now her Uber rating will go down. In my opinion, she‚Äôs a bit of a STEM supremacist as well and likely sympathized with him as a fellow CS major. I think she‚Äôs also somewhat bitter that she never got a return offer from her summer internship in tech, so she‚Äôs perfectly fine with her humanities friends being disrespected to feel better about herself.  The whole exchange lowkey ruined our night out.",

    "selftext": "My boyfriend and I went to get pedicures together, something we rarely do and I thought would be a nice, low-key couples activity. He finished before me, and I still had about 25‚Äì30 minutes left.  Instead of waiting and relaxing, he suddenly said it felt too hot inside and announced that he was going to walk home to ‚Äúget some exercise,‚Äù since his doctor told him to move more. For context, it wasn‚Äôt hot outside at all, it was around 70¬∞ and really pleasant.  He kept asking if I was okay with him leaving, which made it feel even stranger, like he was waiting for permission to do something he already knew I‚Äôd find odd. I told him it was his choice, but I didn‚Äôt really understand why he couldn‚Äôt just wait.  He ended up walking home, which took about 23 minutes. The whole thing felt off, though, mostly because that just so happened to line up exactly with the time his Discord group (which includes one particular female friend he always seems eager to talk to) usually gets online.  I just found it inconsiderate. We went together, it was supposed to be something shared, and he couldn‚Äôt stay 25 more minutes until I was done? It wasn‚Äôt like I was getting a massage or a long service. He basically bailed halfway through a date to make it home in time for an online hangout.  My friends said I wasn‚Äôt being unreasonable and that it was rude of him to leave like that. But he made me feel like I was overreacting for wanting him to stay until the end.  So, am I the asshole for thinking it was disrespectful and asking him to just wait with me until the pedicure was done?  Common question-earlier that day he said make an appointment for both of us to get a pedicure together at 6 PM. I could tell his anxiety was rising around 7:15 PM and I asked him do you have any plans for today? He said no, but he still needed to leave. He told me it was hot inside the nail salon and that his doctor said he needed to exercise more.",
