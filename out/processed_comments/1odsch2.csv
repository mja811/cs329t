1odsch2,nkwca6u,Own-Comparison-5856,NTA - You have attempted to reach out on several occasions and itâ€™s not your responsibility to be constantly available for small talk.,3,1761190283.0,3,0,NTA
1odsch2,nkwcgpy,BigBackeron,"I would say NTA.   Asking for money for drugs is AH behavior, but I also think your friend needed to communicate their feelings to you sooner. If texting isn't working maybe you guys can try phone calls instead? Can you call her on one of your walks? It seems like there's an easy solution to this. If your friend just gave up on texting without communicating, then they're the AH for it.",2,1761190360.0,2,0,NTA
1odsch2,nkwhm43,OrdinaryMajestic4686,"NAH. I've seen similar situations before, as well as experienced them myself. Ya'll are just not compatible when it comes to how you need to stay in touch with each other. It sounds dumb. But in reality, it is a common friendship ender.   Some people get upset when you don't text them back immediately. Some people get upset when you aren't the one to initiate the convos. Some get upset when they're left on read. Some people get upset when they receive casual ""how are you"" messages. And so on.   In my case, I'm the type of person to not reply back until days after, sometimes even weeks. That pisses some people off (usually the ones who think that not receiving immediate responses means the other person is angry at them). So now I have friends who are either like me, or who I can come to an agreement with to meet them halfway. Life is much easier that way.",5,1761192615.0,5,0,NAH
1odsch2,nkwjk2i,ReadMeDrMemory,"NAH. People view texting differently. If someone texts me ""How are you?"" I feel as if they're starting a conversation, and if I text back a reply, I expect them to be there and reply in real time. They have engaged me.  At this point, some friends reply back, because yes, we are indeed having a conversation. I like that. Other friends might leave the message Delivered and unread for a day before replying. I don't like that, but they don't see an issue. I feel as if the adult thing is to realize both these styles exist. You should realize that some people, like your friend, think it's terribly rude not to reply in a more timely way.  I would have suggested you ask her to explain the problem, but apprently that's too much trouble for her, so maybe you've lost a friend through no fault of your own.",2,1761193506.0,2,0,NAH
