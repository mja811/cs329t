1octeus,nkp3uzu,emlarc,"NTA. I think your feelings are totally valid. She blew you off on an important day, and was selfishly worried about herself. That being said, she is/was 17 and I made terrible decisions at that age. If my friends hadn’t shown me grace after breaking up with my first boyfriend (after similarly canceling/sneaking around/ leaving hangouts early) I wouldn’t have my best friend 10 years later.  All this to say- I think you should have a conversation about how she hurt your feelings and how you two can work past this (if that is what you choose). Nobody is perfect, but you have every right to draw your own boundaries as you see fit.",3,1761093113.0,3,0,NTA

1octeus,nkpeymx,Cute-Training8835,"NTA. I totally understand you’re feelings and you have a right to be upset and disappointed! I’d let her know how she made you feel for sure, but I wouldn’t end the friendship over it. It can be tough when friends get in relationships",1,1761097118.0,1,0,NTA
