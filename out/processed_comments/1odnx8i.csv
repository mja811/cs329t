1odnx8i,nkvbvw1,BigBackeron,"NTA. It is absolutely unfair of your roommate to invite R and J back to the apartment without asking you beforehand, especially since she KNEW about your feelings and you two had already established a boundary. If I were you, I would skip the party (if possible) or send her some kind of message that lets her know this is a breach of trust.",49,1761176727.0,49,0,NTA
1odnx8i,nkvdyv3,journeyintopressure,"NTA. Tell the others. And, honestly? I would either cancel the party or let them come and if they started anything, tell them to leave or call them out.   But this should be a group decision.",17,1761177470.0,17,0,NTA
1odnx8i,nkyqus1,emmiec1717,"NTA , go stay in a hotel for the night or at a friend's, so its clear you are not ok with this and will remove yourself from the situation.  It forces the sister and your bf to have to decide if having that ""friend"" over is more important then having you there. Leave the decision up to them , take yourself out of blame for not wanting him there amd simply remove yourself everytime he comes over .bet they stop inviting him",5,1761230450.0,5,0,NTA

1odnx8i,nkzaoo9,Cynic_Picnic,"NTA-- You need to become very assertive in this situation. While I do think people have the ability to change and like to give the benefit of the doubt when I can, what you described seems like a pattern of behavior that a few months cannot fix.   That being said, I want to hear about their behavior at this upcoming party. Please update us. But I suggest that AT the upcoming party, the second J steps over any sort of line (bigoted comments, abusive language or behavior to his partner) CALL HIM OUT PUBLICLY in the group. You can say, ""Roommate has been pleading your case and saying you have changed but clearly she was incorrect and until you do, you will not be welcome here."" Then invite him to leave. (talk to your bf about this strategy beforehand to make sure he is willing to back you up, or take the lead in case he is the one who witnesses J's bad behavior)  You have a right to feel safe in your own home. This isn't actually a situation where you need to have a unanimous vote. J makes you feel unsafe. Your roommate can have any relationship she wants with both R and J outside of your shared living space. But when it comes to who you invite into your space each roommate should have veto power when they feel unsafe.",2,1761236223.0,2,0,NTA
