1ocz866,nkqlxvf,Rredhead926,"These Y T A votes are wild!   There's one swing and multiple people waiting. Obviously, people need to take turns. I've been on both sides of this - the one whose kid was on the cool equipment and needed to get off to let another person try, and the one whose kid was waiting for the cool equipment, and needed to politely ask someone to give my son a turn. No one yelled. No one freaked out. No one cried.   NTA. The girls need to learn to take turns, and the moms are clearly raising entitled brats.",55,1761116746.0,55,0,NTA
1ocz866,nkqqi29,Testingthrowaway00,NTA  It’s a playground kids take turns. That’s the normal thing to do. It’s not hard at all.  If people don’t want you to talk to their children just ignore them. Put your child on that swing without saying a word. Maybe they like that better?,25,1761119497.0,25,0,NTA
1ocz866,nkr5l97,PotentPotentiometer,"NTA. From all the “you’re the ahole” votes here you’d think the lesson here is to just take the swing when it’s offered, even if it’s not your turn, and stay on it for as long as you want with no regard for others.",12,1761128441.0,12,0,NTA

1ocz866,nkrfz85,Cool-Cobbler4324,"Don't want to say YTA because really you just made a poor choice.  Kids need to learn how to negotiate social situations by doing it. You can provide him with encouragement or coaching, but just going upcto other kids is just not a good look.  Best case, they listen to you and your son learns that you will fight his battles...  Worst case...well you pretty much got worst case.",-8,1761133377.0,-8,0,ESH

1ocz866,nkqve1h,Testingthrowaway00,That stranger is just a lot less likely to actually hurt the child than a family member or friend.  However if you are concerned you can walk up and calmly ask what’s going on. You know be a reasonable adult.,-12,1761122524.0,-12,0,ESH

1ocz866,nkqep1u,mindful-bed-slug,"YTA  Sometimes your kid doesn't get to play on the swing.   You could have sent him over to ask the girls to include him (they might have), or you could have found a different fun thing to do with your child at the park or you could have just left the park and told your kid: ""Oh well, we'll try that swing some other day.""  Having a young kid sit there waiting 25 minutes while you are glaring at other children and then being harsh with them and then bursting into tears in the car is a really out-of-proportion reaction for an adult to have to a very mild hiccup.   Teach your kid that not getting what we want is something that we can roll with. We can find another fun way to play. We can move on when things don't work out the way we planned.   Some day, if the college he wants rejects him or the girl dumps him, or a sports injury sidelines him, these early lessons in resilence will help him to get back on his feet.",-13,1761112607.0,-13,0,YTA
1ocz866,nkqge0k,Mowsmom22,"I’ve never even considered addressing other children like that. Your son did not have to go on that swing. In fact, might’ve been a good lesson that we don’t always get what we want. Patiently waiting might have been a better idea. I don’t believe you stood there 20 minutes waiting.

1ocz866,nktao7c,parodytx,"I'm sorry but I'm going to say YTA.  Not for your behavior per se, but for the absolute ASSUMPTION that everyone must share in a situation like this.  Unless there was time limit signage in place, and an authority to enforce it, there is zero requirement for ANY sharing in any public park and the equipment (that goes for toddlers and toys as well.) Whomever has ""ownership"" or possession of the item in question gets to use it until they no longer wish to.  It may be a societal nicety to share, but if the kid wants to ""hog"" the item for hours, they are fully in the right to do so. You have zero authority to tell them to share. You are not the share police.  You can try to impose your beliefs about norms etc. but everyone else may tell you to pound sand when you do.",-13,1761154264.0,-13,0,YTA
1ocz866,nkqrgc6,Swirlyflurry,"YTA  More than just your child were waiting for that swing, and you decided to appoint yourself Big Boss of the Playground so your child could go ahead of them.  It’s a public space. Your kid might not get a turn on every piece of equipment, and certainly won’t get turns when it’s convenient for *you*.",-15,1761120074.0,-15,0,ESH
1ocz866,nkqbaqf,Specialist-Owl2660,"Hmmm....soft YTA. So that was a poor choice. Your a stranger and those children are strangers. If you really wanted to talk to someone it should have been their parents. Not them. Consider the parents POV, you a full grown adult is lecturing their young child while their cousins are scrambling to defend them and when they hear something going on they see their nieces and nephews defending their young child against this grown woman they do not know. That's going to make any parent freak out.   A playground is public property while its of course considerate to take turns technically there are not ""rules"" and young children aren't the most mature. The most you should have done is ask the young girl to point out her parent and then spoke to her parent about the fact your son and you had been waiting 25 minutes and then let the parent handle it. If her mom was rude that is the person you should have been lecturing. Also consider this:   ""But my god, I really don't think I was in the wrong, I have a 13 year old and would have wanted someone to tell him to let other ppl use the equipment.""   Just because you are comfortable with strangers telling your children what to do doesn't mean other people are.",-14,1761110772.0,-14,0,YTA
1ocz866,nkqfgis,myshellly,"YTA…this is weird at best. What kind of example are you setting for your kid if you, as an adult, have a crying tantrum about a swing at a park?   And your son is 8?   Reading this post, I would assume the whole situation was about a toddler.",-14,1761113029.0,-14,0,YTA
