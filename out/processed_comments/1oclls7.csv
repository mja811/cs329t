1oclls7,nknem03,lilperform,"NTA, the 529 is meant for your education, not for your mom to use as control. You’re not entitled for using it to live and study, that’s literally its purpose. She’s being manipulative and trying to punish you for setting boundaries. Don’t give it back tho",53,1761073838.0,53,0,NTA
1oclls7,nknrgb6,specialklmn,"OP, I saw in a comment of yours that your mom transferred ownership of your 529 account to you. This means that the money is yours to spend either on school or school-related expenses (as intended) or on anything else you want plus the fees and taxes associated with non-educational expenses. Your mom has literally no say.   It sounds like you feel conflicted about whether to use your money for its intended purpose. As if you think your mom has a legitimate claim to it. Why do you feel this way? The money was funded by your mom and dad, ownership was conferred to your mom in the divorce because she got sole custody - NOT because it was her money, because it was your money - and has since transferred ownership to you. As always intended. Guilt is not remotely appropriate here.  TBH, sounds like your mom is trying to screw you in the only way she can because of that fight. She wants the money back not because of some financial hole she fell into (you didn't mention any financial concerns), but just to stick it to you. Think about how juvenile, self serving, mean, petty, entirely awful that is for anyone to behave that way but especially your MOTHER. Then ask yourself again why on earth that behavior should make you feel guilty?! Because it shouldn't.  NTA absolutely. Finish college, build a life. Hopefully your jerk of a mom will wake up before too long and ask to be a part of it",36,1761077400.0,36,0,NTA
1oclls7,nknh3uc,AlbanyBarbiedoll,"It's in your name, which makes it your money. She has no legal leg to stand on. Do you have ANY relationship with your father? If you do, make him aware of this situation. Maybe he (or his lawyer) can make her see reason.",19,1761074532.0,19,0,NTA
1oclls7,nknn0j2,KrofftSurvivor,"Any withdrawal from this fund that you make that does not go directly towards educational expenses is taxable and the person whose name is on the account is responsible for those taxes.  Since the account that was planned for your educational expenses is now in your name, what your mother is asking you to do is give her money that you will have to pay taxes on.  Ignore her. If it was in her name, she could go ahead and shut it down, and take the hit tax wise.  She put it in your name.It was intended for your educational expenses.Do not allow her pressuring you to screw up your education.Nor your taxes.",15,1761076160.0,15,0,NTA
1oclls7,nkncdch,National-Report-5473,"INFO: does she have any right for this money?  Most likely though, based on her reasoning behind asking, NTA.

1oclls7,nknkzof,jillian512,NTA. Fortunately she already put the account in your name. Maybe double check with the bank and make sure she doesn't have access to the account in any way.,4,1761075606.0,4,0,NTA
1oclls7,nknifwf,Cosi-grl,"Anything that has not been disbursed to you is controlled by your mother and she determines who gets it.  But if she has already given you the funds then I think you don’t have to give anything back.  if she presses, consult an attorney.",3,1761074902.0,3,0,NTA
1oclls7,nkop2n9,Hennahands,"NTA, the 529 is a tax incentive account. Your mother has already reaped the benefits. Please remember that REGARDLESS of the 529 you are eligible for student aid, counselling services and any other college support. Do right by yourself.",3,1761087907.0,3,0,INFO
1oclls7,nknp2it,Buckeyebean,"Everything depends on who is the “owner” of the 529. If your Mother’s name is on it. She can legally take the money and pay taxes on the dispersal. If the account is in your name only then it is yours to use for your education. Unfortunately, most likely your Mom holds the cards. Sadly, because you are under 25 she needs to give you her tax returns for your FAFSA. I’m sorry OP, It sucks for you. Be prepared for more student loans.",2,1761076727.0,2,0,INFO

1oclls7,nkpilg2,exbayoubelle,NTA. That money was put aside so you could go to school.  It is yours. Your parent’s taxes were lower because that money was yours. Don’t feel guilty.  You can and should limit contact for your mental health.  You can always re-establish communication later. ( difficult but possible. I did after 3 years) good luck. Please don’t waste your education on a major that will not give you a living wage once you graduate.  Also go to grad school as soon as you are able. It is easier before you have a family to support and a full time job.,2,1761098445.0,2,0,INFO

1oclls7,nku29up,Jealous-Contract7426,"Don't give her back the 529. You can only remove that money for school. If you take the money out and give it to her, you will be committing fraud as will she since she got tax breaks on her contributions. Ignore her. Stop going home. Keep your head down and get through school so you can make your own life.   NTA",1,1761162257.0,1,0,NTA
