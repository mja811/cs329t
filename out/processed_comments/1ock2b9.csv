You are valid to be this upset, and I encourage you to go out and make more friends and find some that treat you better. Join clubs or find some hobby groups and broaden your friend group. This is, unfortunately, not an uncommon experience for teens, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt. Just remember, it’s not you, and it’s ok to put some distance between you and these girls.",7,1761070490.0,7,0,NTA

1ock2b9,nkn8zl6,Fuzzy_Whereas1495,"You can make new friends!   It's better to be alone than to surround yourself with people who make you feel useless and unwanted. I went through this exact same thing at your age and trust me it's better in the long run to stand up for yourself and walk away than let these toxic people keep making you doubt yourself at such a psychologically formative time in your life.    My advice is to **quietly** distance yourself from them! Maybe join a club or find a new hobby outside of school or wherever you are around these girls, and use that as 1. a way to make new friends and 2. a way to keep up the appearance of having a busy social life ( as I know teenagers want to represent these days especially using social media), so no one can say anything about you not having friends or whatever.   **Do not** try to have some big come-to-jesus conversation with these girls either, especially Natasha, even though I know you still want to hang on to such an old friendship. It is more than likely in this scenario Natasha will just go running back to Alice and tell her you were ""talking shit"" or whatever else they can use to bond over ther distance from you, and you'll give the two of them more ammo to go be talking shit about you, honestly.    Keep in mind that friendships go through phases and people are changing *a lot* and rapidly during their teenage years. Honestly, since Alice has already proven herself to be a bad friend to you, it shouldn't be long until she treats Natasha the same way. In that case you will have your bases covered to receive Natasha back into your life, both of you having escaped the same toxic friend. However it is also possible that in quietly distancing yourself you will lose Natasha as a friend for good, but let me tell you girl, if that happens, you dodged a bullet because there is obviously some shared traits between them.   College isn't so far away! You got this and there will be sooo many more friends and laughs to be had with people who aren't weird and awful.",3,1761072279.0,3,0,NTA
1ock2b9,nknjdop,CrewelSummer,"&gt;I don't need constant attention; I just want some effort in return.  You can want that, but you can't make her give it to you.  You can never control the behavior of others.  And Natasha is indicating pretty clearly with her behavior that she's not interested in putting effort into a relationship with you.  So you need to receive that, and instead of clinging to her in the hopes that she will magically change (she will not), you need to let go of a friendship that is not meeting your needs.  This now becomes a conversation with your parents.  It is not healthy to have only 1 or 2 friends.  You need a wider social network than that.  If being homeschooled is not providing you with enough opportunities to socialize and make more friends, then your parents need to help address that.  You need to find opportunities for socialization in other ways, like clubs, hobby groups, church groups, or anything else that will allow you to interact with more of your peers and make friends.    NTA but this is an issue with homeschooling.  You're lacking in opportunities to socialize, make friends, and build relationship skills, and because of that, you are not able to navigate common social issues in a healthy manner.",1,1761075166.0,1,0,NTA
1ock2b9,nkntp0j,Kitchen_Chemistry405,NTA - this is a sign from the universe that you deserve better friends! Hanging around people who are constantly mad/upset at the world is no way to spend your life. Find the people who will support you when you're down AND celebrate your good days,1,1761078026.0,1,0,NTA
