1odkxl5,nkuskmy,Impossible_Rain_4727,"YTA: Try and have more empathy.  He’s a kid caught between two fighting parents, bouncing between two homes with completely different rules and expectations. I don’t blame him for struggling to understand why the rules are different between them.  He’s not handling their co-parenting well, obviously. That doesn’t mean he deserves to be punished at Christmas. I honestly blame the parents far more for the situation.  Taking away Christmas gifts is only going to harm his relationship with his mother further. He has only just started coming around again. The focus should be on rebuilding his relationship with her.  Honestly, it is also 100% not your place to judge whether he’s 'earned' christmas gifts. This whole situation is something your mum should handle, not you.",43,1761170017.0,43,0,YTA

1odkxl5,nkustqi,Hi_hello_hi_howdy,"How old are you? It sounds like there are a lot of moving pieces here. I’m sorry that your mom is using you as a coparent for your younger siblings.  It’s hard to feel responsible for their wellbeing on a regular basis, and also feel like you don’t get any say in their rules or consequences.   In my opinion, Christmas isn’t a good time for punishments.    I would tell your mom she’s asking too much of you, and move out if you’re over 18, but I’m guessing based on the story that your mom has some mental health issues of her own she’s dealing with. Sorry you are in a tough situation",16,1761170099.0,16,0,NAH
1odkxl5,nkuza65,K_A_irony,Stop trying to be the parent.  If she fails and he becomes a leech that also won't be your issue.   Now it is fair to tell her that you are not happy with the unequal treatment.   It isn't fair that he gets to do X and you don't.   Ask her why she is OK with that and then listen.  It would also be fair to point out she is enabling him to be an entitled brat and that won't help him be independent and a functioning member of society and that after you are 18 you get the choice of whether you associate with him or not and that you won't pick up ANY of the slack or costs for her as a result of him.,14,1761172295.0,14,0,NAH
1odkxl5,nkut8p3,paul_rudds_drag_race,"He acts like a big-time brat but he also has another parent who seems to be pulling some strings. With that, excluding him from receiving gifts is going to make him want to stay away even more, which hurts your mother. Of course this doesn’t mean she should go all out to bribe him because he’ll learn that acting out results in rewards. It’s ultimately her decision. I understand your frustration though.",8,1761170234.0,8,0,YTA
1odkxl5,nkuw32h,BigBackeron,"Yes, YTA. You're not the parent here. Telling your mom to not give her son gifts for Christmas would be AH behavior. Stereotypical older child.   But let me add: do you really think your brother was entirely to blame for this? He's 11. You should be able to connect the dots and realize that your father likely influenced him or wouldn't let him go home. The way this post is worded makes it seem like you're putting the full blame on your brother, which is... very closed-minded.",7,1761171192.0,7,0,YTA
1odkxl5,nkuza84,keesouth,YTA 1. This isn't your place. It's up to your mom to decide how to parent your brother. 2. You aren't thinking like a parent. You are thinking like another kid in the house and you don't have the same judgment your mom has. 3. Even though you are in the same house as your brother you are not living the same experience due to age and other factors. You have no idea how he truly feels. 4. Your opinion also seems to be tainted about how you feel about his father and stepmother.   Long story short just do what you're supposed to do and let your mom handle your brother.,7,1761172295.0,7,0,YTA
1odkxl5,nkv68r5,Limp-Paint-7244,"Leave the gifts out of it. But I do think you should say something like ""Mom, I know you want brother to keep coming back here. But it is really messed up that he keeps breaking rules and doing whatever the heck he wants. He should respect you more. You are a wonderful mom."" Hug and walk away.",3,1761174761.0,3,0,YTA
1odkxl5,nkw3s9c,Legal-Run-4034,"YTA. This reads a lot more like you want to hurt your brother rather than help your mother or even help your brother to become a better person and follow the rules. You have to keep in mind that your mother is trying to teach you rules and responsibilities and turn you into functional adults (hopefully). And she WANTS to do the same for your brother (again, hopefully), but your brother's father is spewing poison into his ear and letting him do whatever in an attempt to hurt your mother and she has to bend a bit just to make sure she doesn't lose him completely from what I've read here. Forcing extreme punishments like nothing for Christmas is only going to drive your brother to his father and away from your mother.",3,1761186855.0,3,0,YTA
1odkxl5,nkuxfoo,LowBalance4404,"YTA because this isn't up to you.  What I would do in your situation is study as much as you can, get the best grades possible, get a part time job to save for college and as soon as you can, leave this toxic situation.

1odkxl5,nkv47he,StatisticianSmall864,"You are not an AH. However, you also are not a parent and it’s not your responsibility to manage the family. Time to stop interfering. As someone who managed a family far before I was prepared, it’s not good for your brain, your emotions, your grades to being parenting at 16. Your mom needs to stop going out at night and be present for her family. You need to be at school, doing your work, and maybe even getting a job so you can stay out of the house and start socking money away so you can leave ASAP.",1,1761174035.0,1,0,NTA
1odkxl5,nkvea1n,Character_Goat_6147,"Hon, I’m so sorry. You’re NTA, but both your parents are. Your father has manipulated your little brother, who is too young and dumb to know he is being manipulated. He doesn’t love the kid, if he did he wouldn’t do this. He just wants to win. Your mother is so upset that she has capitulated and is now playing your father’s game, which means a dimwit 13 year old is running both houses. This is bad news for everyone. Your mom should have held firm for the sake of you and your siblings. Your brother needs to understand that he is not the boss, because he’s clearly not capable of regulating himself. This is bigger than Christmas presents. I understand the urge not to reward him for bad behavior, but she’s too scared that he will see it as a rejection and she won’t do it.   Your mom’s rules aren’t wrong. Life is hard enough and exceptionally uncertain right now. Your mom is trying to instill self-motivation and determination into the rest of you, and to keep you from spending all your time on things like gaming, that can take over our lives and keep us from functioning. Self-regulating as a teenager can be really hard, which is why good parents set limits to help us do that. Having the self-discipline to do the hard stuff, the stuff that’s not so fun, the important stuff, is what will  give us the opportunities to have a better life in the long run. Giving in to every dopamine urge just makes that harder, and like all addiction it just gets worse over time. It makes it too easy to hide from life. Your brother is not on a good road, and in my opinion your mom isn’t handling it well because she’s letting her own emotions override what is better for your brother. Now that he knows he can manipulate her and that there are no rules, he will keep pushing boundaries until he completely crashes.    You can’t fix this. You can certainly tell your brother what you think of his behavior, but this is too big for you to solve. The best thing you can do is to realize that taking your brother’s path is a bad idea, and keep helping your younger siblings to the extent you can. I’m sorry your mom isn’t stepping up, but it’s not your fault.",1,1761177582.0,1,0,ESH

At the same time, you're 16, it isn't your responsibility to parent anyone. I know that instinct is coming from a good place, wanting to make sure your siblings and your mom are okay. As their older sibling, all you can really do is be there for them. It isn't your responsibility to dole out punishments.    Have you tried talking to your brother? If I was in his shoes, I know I would be hurting for someone to talk to, or just anyone in my corner. Growing up is hard.

(It should actually be your mum warning him because she's the parent, not you but...) When I worked with kids, it worked better to tell them ""you've got 30, 10, 5 ect mins left"" because then it wasn't a sudden stop for the kid and they had time to prepare for it.

1odkxl5,nkvj0mm,Loud_et_Proud,"NTA it sounds like your bros dad has a favourite son and it's him. He allows him to do whatever he wants and probably poisons himself against your mom constantly. So that bleeds on to your bro and the way he acts.   I'm sure your mom won't not give him gifts but I agree he doesn't need a ton. Maybe one thing for each kid. However, your mom can save that money and reward the other kid with gifts over the year or something for being good (this way your bro learns).  You are only 16 tho, so try and have fun and stay out of it all of you can. You're being. A good daughter and sister where you can but don't forget about you.
