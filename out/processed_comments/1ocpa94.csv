1ocpa94,nko8wqw,BigBackeron,I'm assuming Monica = Mony = Mouni?¬†   NTA. It's unfortunate that your father played the favoritism game and had higher expectations for you unfairly. I would stop talking to the other half of the family and the father as they clearly won't stop being toxic anytime soon.,527,1761082423.0,527,0,NTA
1ocpa94,nkoefvc,Paevatar,"NTA  In some ways your father has done you a favor. You are strong and able to earn your living. Your younger sisters presumably will be, as well.  However your father's spoiling has made the three older ones weak and useless. I wonder who is going to support their idleness once your father is gone.",182,1761084205.0,182,0,NTA
1ocpa94,nkoxb5o,MesaAdelante,Honestly I‚Äôd tell my father that they didn‚Äôt have a mother but you and your younger siblings didn‚Äôt have a father because he pretty much abandoned you.,163,1761090785.0,163,0,NTA
1ocpa94,nkoghwe,Think_Storm_8909,Cut off contact completely. Work on your future and build your life. Don't look back at all when your dad is old and alone and needs a caretaker because his favorite children drop him like a decaying chicken,82,1761084911.0,82,0,NTA
1ocpa94,nkp68my,OutragedPineapple,"NTA  ""I'm supposed to feel bad for them getting everything they ever wanted handed to them while me and my actual sisters starved and froze because they didn't have a mother? My real sisters and I didn't have a mother either, or a father, because the two of you were far too busy kissing their asses to remember we existed.  As far as I'm concerned, myself and my actual sisters are orphans. I will not send you money or help you with anything. You will not be at my wedding, you will not meet my children. You are nothing to me. Your daughters are nothing to me. They can cry and pretend like they're sad little victims all they want, but I am done catering to their whims and pretending we have anything in common. We might have grown up in the same house, but we had completely different lives. They had a home and a family that gave them everything. My real sisters and I had nothing and no one but each other, and now? We don't need you. We don't want you. You are nothing, and we will not help you. You'd best hope at least one of your spoiled brats manages to trick someone into marrying her that has money, because we will not be taking care of you in your old age. The only ones you gave a damn about can take on that burden.""",63,1761093960.0,63,0,NTA

1ocpa94,nkoro03,Elegant-Way-595,"Wow‚Ä¶ that sounds seriously messy üò¨. Like, you‚Äôve been hustling your whole life, working and helping out, and your sisters just‚Ä¶ got spoiled rotten? Totally makes sense you called it out. Don‚Äôt feel bad for being real with them. Just, like, keep standing your ground and don‚Äôt get sucked into all their drama too much ‚ù§Ô∏è.",18,1761088812.0,18,0,NTA

1ocpa94,nkr3kkt,Ordinary-Audience363,NTA. You finally made it clear that the two sisters had always gotten preferential treatment. Someone had to tell them.,3,1761127357.0,3,0,NTA
1ocpa94,nkv0vnt,MelodyRaine,"NTA next time your father calls  ""You have six daughters.  Three got designer dresses, high end clothing, new cars and attended private colleges with no expectations that they contribute to the household.  Three couldn't ask for the price of a soft drink without being guilted, had to wear their clothing until it fell apart, and are expected to start working to pay into the house as soon as they turn eighteen.    Which ones should people feel sorry for?  Because I assure you it isn't your 'sweet motherless children' aka the three leeches being treated like the Kardashians on my dime.  You were so concerned with making things up to those three that you forgot the twins and I existed until we were old enough to fund your guilt trips.  Fix this before you lose half your children over this gross favoritism.""",6,1761172856.0,6,0,NTA
1ocpa94,nkry84w,Supernova-Max,NTA Wow talk about toxic! My advice is to distance yourself from that entire family and leave your dad to take care of his golden children. While you work on yourself and keep in close contact with your siblings.,3,1761140063.0,3,0,YTA
