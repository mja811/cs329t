1odsh8m,nkwb6t2,addictedtodesserts,"I mean, it depends on what your definition of booty shorts is. because I googled images just to be sure, and there's some where there's definitely butt cheeks hanging out. My impression was that they cover the cheeks but don't go further down much.   It boils down to if you're being respectful to others vs. Someone telling you what you can and can't wear. I think showing butt cheeks, side boobs,  or wearing lingerie when someone comes over is crossing that respect line.  Same thing if a man has boxers and no pants. I get that I'm coming over to your house, but geez",26,1761189822.0,26,0,NTA

1odsh8m,nkw9y5q,BigBackeron,"I mean, it seems like at this point it's widely accepted that people can wear really short shorts in public places. In your own home I feel like you could have guests over even if you're wearing pajamas.   So you're NTA. Some people don't think people should wear ""booty shorts"" in public, but regardless of anyone's opinions on that, in your own living space it should be allowed.",15,1761189305.0,15,0,NTA
1odsh8m,nkwf8a1,SDBadKitty,"Soft YTA. You have a guest in your home. It's a matter of respect to have some decorum when a guest is in your home. You state in your own terms that these are ""booty shorts"". So,no, not guest appropriate. If this is your father's friend, I am guessing it's an ""older"" person as well. Yeah sure, it's your house.....but when you have a guest coming over, maybe try to put some pants or longer shorts on. (And, yes, I will change my clothes if I have a guest coming over. I'm not trying to welcome a guest in my pajamas or something like ""booty shorts"".)",7,1761191560.0,7,0,YTA
1odsh8m,nkwap7d,Impossible_Rain_4727,"NAH: If someone was visiting, I would be more mindful/intentional with my outfit choice.

1odsh8m,nkwe26z,Swirlyflurry,"NAH  It‚Äôs your home, it‚Äôs fine for you to be comfortable there.  But if what you‚Äôre wearing makes someone uncomfortable, they are also free to leave.

1odsh8m,nkwgcvb,WerewolfCommercial26,"Info: how short are the shorts?  I don't think you need to wear pants but if they are revealing it's kinda weird. If they arent something you'd wear to the grocery store you probably should change if someone is coming over.  I probably would change because I'd feel uncomfortable and depending on how short/tight they are, it could be inappropriate. Kinda like, I put a bra on whenever someone comes over. A certain level of decency should be adhered to when guests come over, even if it's very casual.",8,1761192056.0,8,0,INFO
1odsh8m,nkwcwc5,LowBalance4404,"It really depends.  My guideline is would I wear this to church or in front of my Nana? And no, I don't mean in terms of dressy, but in terms of are my ass cheeks and nips visible or not.

1odsh8m,nkwg2dl,Vyckerz,"YTA - I‚Äôm sorry, but even the shorts you showed in the link, depending on your anatomy, could look very inappropriate if you are having guests over.

If you're talking about something you'd only wear to the beach or pool, like a denim bikini, then maybe not when you're not at the beach or pool.   I'd vote ""no assholes here"" only if your boyfriend is worried because the visitor is an elder and deserving of extra respect in his mind.

1odsh8m,nkwj0yr,JirinkaPine,"NTA.  Might be slight cultural differences (I'm Australian), but I'd consider booty shorts to be pants. If you're fine to wear to the gym and afterwards to coffee, then no men are going to be damaged by seeing you wear comfortable clothing in your own home. If you were wearing a crop and booty shorts, then probably throw a shirt on beforehand.",2,1761193258.0,2,0,NAH

1odsh8m,nkwho6r,No-Assignment5538,"NTA. You should not feel any need to cover up to make anyone comfortable. It is their job to control their reactions, not your job to cover your body. If your BF doesn't understand that and thinks it is your job to police your body so other men don't look at you or sexualize you, even if he presents it 'jokingly', he is actually part of the problem.  Men (and boys) need to learn that women's (and girls') bodies are not there for their consumption, we need to put the responsibility on the people doing the sexualizing instead of the people being sexualized.
