1odtj1x,nkwivrz,Superb_Drop1313,All this drama is because you ended your text with a period instead of a question mark? Nta. Your BIL is ridiculous,61,1761190000,61,0,NTA
1odtj1x,nkwjer3,HowlPen,"NTA Are you doing this as a favor? His entitlement to your help, without even feeling the need to be polite and grateful, says a lot about him. You didn’t do anything wrong in any way.",41,1761190000,41,0,NTA
1odtj1x,nkwph3c,Mandiezie1,"NTA. For someone who wants a babysitter. Bc he’s at home, he is unnecessarily anal. “Phrase it like a question” is ridiculous. He should watch his own kid if this is necessary.",24,1761200000,24,0,NTA
1odtj1x,nkwlbc3,OrdinaryMajestic4686,NTA. I don’t think you did anything wrong. You were delegated responsibility over the kid. You already knew more or less the routine. You had already gone to park before and it was ok. You even let BIL know where you were going. It wasn’t like you took your nephew to some unknown place or kidnapped him.  Does BIL have separation anxiety or something? Idk how he will be able to deal with it when he has to send the kid to preschool.,13,1761190000,13,0,NTA
1odtj1x,nkwr6n5,ReadMeDrMemory,NTA. They need to start paying a babysitter they (hopefully) feel less free to abuse.,9,1761200000,9,0,NTA
1odtj1x,nkxm3br,soph_lurk_2018,NTA you let him know you’re taking your nephew to the park. He’s angry it was a statement and not a question. He’s being ridiculous and extremely ungrateful. You’re not your BIL’s punching bag. He’s not your husband. You don’t have to coddle his feelings or stoke his ego. Stop babysitting.,9,1761220000,9,0,NTA
1odtj1x,nkx1nl8,International-Fee255,NTA Sounds like a household where they walk on eggshells around husband.,8,1761200000,8,0,NTA
1odtj1x,nkxkiwa,loobyloo488,"NTA  If I was working from home and the babysitter sent a text stating they were going to the park,  I'd be overjoyed. Kid gets fresh air and exercise and the house is quiet for an hour, win/win",4,1761210000,4,0,NTA
1odtj1x,nkycjuc,CreativeMusic5121,"NTA, but your BIL sure is. ""Just let them know"" when you want to take nephew to the park carries the implication that you just need to inform, not ask permission and wait for a response.   Without context, perhaps BIL did freak out because he didn't see the text, was embarrassed that he overreacted, so tried to cover by saying you should have phrased it as a question, but that assumes this isn't a pattern of controlling behavior. Your sister saying it's better to ""phrase it like a question"" casts doubt on that, though. I wonder if she herself has to phrase everything that way.   I think maybe it's best if you continue to babysit your nephew (to maintain contact with him and your sis incase husband gets more controlling), but not at their house, if that is an option.",3,1761230000,3,0,NTA
1odtj1x,nkxeb25,Moose-Live,"NTA. Don't understand the issue. You cleared it with both of them first. Presumably you want to babysit again, so asking exactly what went wrong would probably be a good idea",3,1761210000,3,0,NTA
1odtj1x,nkz1875,Civil-Personality256,Tell them with these shitty ass rules they can hire a babysitter,3,1761230000,3,0,NTA
1odtj1x,nkzo82e,Suspicious_Juice717,NTA  I can understand the sudden surge of anxiety when you don't know where your kid is for a split second. It's not a good feeling.   That being said he's using the punctuation in a text as a technicality to not apologize to you.  He owes you an apology.,3,1761240000,3,0,NTA
1odtj1x,nkwjakk,Competitive_Test6697,"Might not matter but what age are you? Are you seen as super responsible or was their a reason it took 2 years to get this honour of being allowed to watch you nephew?  Also, did you message the other 2 days and that was fine because you worded it as a request? Or was this the first time you messages and worded it as you are doing this rather than asking?",2,1761190000,2,0,INFO
1odtj1x,nkybkpx,thatladybri,He just sounds like an anxious dad. I absolutely would freak out if someone took my kid somewhere without asking me/confirming I got the text before leaving.,2,1761230000,2,0,NAH
1odtj1x,nkwl0e6,tater_cakes,"The gentlest YTA. He may not have seen the text and came upstairs, realized he had no idea where his kiddo or you were and that momentary where's my kid fear is pretty primal. In the future make sure he acknowledges he's aware you're leaving before you leave. Just to avoid panic by dad.",-4,1761190000,-4,0,YTA
