1ocz9b1,nkr61y4,Appropriate_Storm1,"Jesus Christ. Grow a pair of balls and stop rolling over for these people.   First, time to get a formal custody agreement through the court and follow it. Period. No exceptions. Keep ALL communications strictly between you and your ex, and only use a parenting app approved through the courts. Block all other family memebers. Your son can see that side on his dads time.   Second, file a restraining order for harassment against your ex MIL. The builder even told you what she was doing is unethical. Why would you give in to the drama? Why would you let that cost YOUR SON A FOREVER HOME?!? Seriously?   Apologize to your son for being weak. Then call the builder, buy the home, and be the strong parent that does the right thing even when it’s hard. Your son is watching.

1ocz9b1,nkqtyfh,hellomynameisrita,"They have been too much in your life,  in ways that you thought were just being cooperative, but it was never about cooperation.  it was about manipulation and being able to know all your business that they don't actually have a right to know.   Not that they will ever admit to this, they will only ever believe they were being helpful, and that YOU are the one who behaved badly and threw it in their faces.  You are in a dangerous spot now, the most dangerous time is when they think you are leaving them.  Despite the divorce being that far in the past, it is only know, when he knows you are in another relationship, that he actually FEELS that you are truly gone.  Check up on your home security, remind your family and coworkers and the parents of your Childs friends/adult leaders of activities,  that since you are divorced, they should not speak to him about you, your habits, your plans.  Reduce contact and interactions for dealing with the kid to only those described in the divorce decree. communicate with the app so everything is documented.  Consider changing. your phone number.

1ocz9b1,nkr1gjj,Athingwithfeathers2,I came to support the advice given.   You need your lawyer to notify the court about the family harassing you and not following custody agreement.  You should send screen shots and any other supporting evidence to state real estate licensing board. Ask the builder if he'll write up a short statement of his experience with your MIL. What she did was illegal and unethical.  Consider going to small claims court to get reimbursed for expenses incurred for a vaction you had to forego thanks to the ex withholding your child.  They will stop messing with you if you make it too painful. I'd send them a copy of the divorce decree with a note telling them it's none of their business if you're dating or not. You're a free woman. It sounds like you unloaded hundreds of pounds of dead weight you were dragging around.,14,1761126179.0,14,0,NTA

You aren’t in the wrong, but I can also understand why MIL is upset with you.
