1od1z69,nkqrc1e,dilley07,Ahahahaha I did shit like this. You all knowingly broke the law. You’re still learning how to get away with things. There was no way you weren’t going to get caught.

1od1z69,nkuzkj0,Purple_Mine_1676,"NTA. Congrats on having fun in a group!  When people get caught doing negative things they will often try to throw blame around. Don't worry about it, it doesn't mean anything.  Try to defend yourself without being nasty about it.   Regarding alcohol... I'm glad to hear you rebels are going to college next year, at first I thought you were 14. Drinking is fun and cool and makes you popular, or something, but don't go overboard. One or two drinks is enough for a  buzz and that's all the social lubrication you need.  Never ever drink alone. That's a sure sign that you're heading towards addiction.  Tune in next time for more unsolicited non-parental advice!",1,1761172396.0,1,0,NTA
