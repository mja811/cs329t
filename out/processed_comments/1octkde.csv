1octkde,nkp564d,RustyRapeAxeWife,YOU are allowing her to hijack your life. She isn’t holding a gun to your head!  Grow a pair and set boundaries. Have consequences for her violating those boundaries and stick to it. You’ll be crap at parenting if you don’t learn this with your MIL now.,206,1761093586.0,206,0,YTA
1octkde,nkp6z9q,ThatsItImOverThis,FFS STOP TELLING HER ANYTHING.  YTA because you keep doing this to yourself.   She can’t be trusted to keep her mouth shut? Don’t tell her anything.  She hijacks parties? Stop planning them with her.  You cause this drama by engaging with her. Start learning how to deal with the baby you’re about to have when they grow into a toddler by learning how to deal with the toddler you call your MIL. Holy crap,91,1761094225.0,91,0,YTA
1octkde,nkp2awo,Wild_Ticket1413,NTA. The only two people who have to agree on your daughter's name are you and your husband. You're in agreement. No one else's opinion matters here. Name your child whatever you want.,27,1761092554.0,27,0,NTA

1octkde,nkp4ifo,Disastrous-Assist-90,"NTA but you need to put that lady on a serious information diet, and start setting some really hard boundaries. Thank God, your husband doesn’t have his head in the sand. Let her have all the tantrums she wants… She can get blocked until if/when she figures life out.",20,1761093347.0,20,0,NTA
1octkde,nkp3eua,Neither-Act-9656,"NTA.  She is your child and you have the right to name her whatever you want.  You probably want to consider going LC/NC with MIL starting immediately.  Otherwise, queue the drama when you go into labor.  She'll be demanding to be in the delivery room with you.  Just because it is her first grandbaby doesn't give her any rights.  In fact, you might want to head things off and review the laws in your state about grandparent rights.  She sounds like she's unhinged enough that she might try something.  Kudos to hubby for having your back and standing up to his parents!  Sounds like he's a keeper.",18,1761092951.0,18,0,NTA
1octkde,nkp98uw,pegasussoaringhigh,"Name your child whatever you wish, but don't tell ANYONE, especially MIL until after the birth. In the meantime, go NC, or at the very least LC. Don't share any more pregnancy news with anyone. Good luck.",17,1761095026.0,17,0,NTA

1octkde,nkp7h11,fIumpf,"You are NTA for changing the name. However, **where is your husband?**  Why is he not controlling **his** narc **mother**? He is just as guilty as enabling as everyone else in this picture save the one time he snapped.   Y’all have a wishbone where spines should be. STOP telling her things. You knew she wouldn’t keep it to herself and are somehow disappointed she didn’t? Cut her and everyone who enables her off. Full no contact. Let her go nuclear. Let her throw tantrums. Ignore her.   Are you really going to let her around your baby? She will do things behind your back as she has proven over and over she cannot be trusted.",9,1761094397.0,9,0,NTA

1octkde,nkp8kfg,robbiea1353,"Dear OP, NTA for choosing a different name because you’re the parent.   However, you would be the AH  to yourself and DH if you do not set up firm boundaries now. Do not let JNMIL’s over bearing and obnoxious behavior continue.   She’ll probably want to be in the delivery room; move in and take over (while making rude comments); and try to get LO to call her “mama”. This is the hill to die on.",8,1761094784.0,8,0,NTA

This MIL is way too involved in your life. You need to set boundaries. You think she interferes now?? You haven’t seen anything yet.

1octkde,nkpb3bk,bgriff425,"NTA. But you and your husband need to start setting boundaries as a team with your in-laws (yes, both of them). I don’t know for sure but there’s probably a good chance that she will try to raise your girl for you if you don’t set boundaries. She will play the victim when you do that - it’s what narcissists do. Just stay calm and stay the course. Good luck.",2,1761095695.0,2,0,NTA
1octkde,nkpfecv,BeachCatDog,"YOU are the mother.   NOONE can sign the baby papers in the hospital but YOU. Not even your husband. A nurse will even ask everyone to leave the room, if you need time to sign the papers in privacy.   YOU can name the new baby any name you want. There are few times a mother comes first in society.

You need to stop compromising!  &gt;We wanted to do a gender reveal party mother-in-law tried to hijack that event again and forced us to do it at a location that we weren’t comfortable with at her sister‘s house because we stated we didn’t want to have the party there  ""The gender reveal part is going to be at X location. If you want to go to your sister's house then do so but we're doing it at the place we chose.""  &gt;queue World War 3.  As far as I can see, the response should be ""We've told you the situation. If you don't grow up and accept it you're not invited at all.""  &gt;Husband and FIL get into a huge screaming match,   He doesn't need his father's permission to do anything and neither do you. FIL can scream. Husband should simply state his decision.  &gt;Husband agreed and we have since decided that daughter’s second middle name will be my husband’s now late grandmother’s name am I the asshole for changing my daughter’s middle name?
