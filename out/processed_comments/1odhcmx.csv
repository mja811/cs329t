1odhcmx,nktw1o9,Purple_Shallot3731,Sometimes friendships end.   NAH. People grow apart. Priorities change. There's a very high likelihood your best friend when you were 14 is not going to be your best friend in adult life.,11,1761160447.0,11,0,NAH
1odhcmx,nktxq7h,jjrobinson73,"NAH  I am 52, and I have ONE best friend I have been friends with since I was 3 years old. Otherwise, some people who I was best friends with in HS, I no longer talk to. Some people I recently met and am good friends with, those friendships are very new.   Friends are like ships in the night. Sometimes you pass each other by, and when you do, you pick up where you left off. Others you set a different course and when you do see them so much has changed. But, that's the ebb and flow of friendships. They come and go. You are this friend might be growing apart. Sexuality isn't a common bond between the sexes. (You both attracted to same sex people....at least that's how I read it. It sounds like you both are gay??) Even if you both are, there is still a difference in lives as you get old. Hell, this is why some married people don't last. They grow apart.   I would just say, you don't need to constantly reach out, but every once in a while, just send him something cute and then let it go. If he still doesn't answer, then you can probably chalk that friendship up to being one that has ran its course.",5,1761160940.0,5,0,NAH
1odhcmx,nktwvpn,Novel_Fox,"I can't call you an AH for missing your friend but try to keep in mind people grow and change. You said he's got a girlfriend, and also that the most active he's been in your friendship was when you had a partner aswell. Do you know his partner? Is it a female that might be jealous even though you're not into guys? Or maybe the timing was just a coincidence. Either way I'd back off. If he's not willing to pin something down or make time to hang out he might have moved on and just didn't say anything to you about it.",3,1761160692.0,3,0,NAH
1odhcmx,nku2cx5,NoHorseNoMustache,"NAH, if you're going to different schools it can be tough.  I stayed friends with my bff from home when I went to college but I was never in a romantic relationship in college, if I had been it would have been tougher to make time for my bff from home I'm sure.",4,1761162282.0,4,0,NAH
1odhcmx,nktx2du,ilittledream,"NTA, you’re not clingy for missing your friend. It’s fair to feel hurt when you’re the only one putting in effort. Give him space and see if he reaches out, that’ll show if he still values the friendship",2,1761160746.0,2,0,NTA
1odhcmx,nkty6a5,Fast-Recognition-942,NTA what you feel is valid but with time relationships and priorities change. Try to expand your other friendships bc it kinda sounds like you’re really dependent on him. I know it sucks but life moves on. Move on with it as well and don’t get stuck &lt;3,2,1761161071.0,2,0,NTA
1odhcmx,nktzj7v,Kitchen_Chemistry405,"NTA - sometimes relationships change, especially when seperated by physical distance. I say continue to be friends with him as much as you like but make sure you're taking the chance to meet all the new people in your life too!",2,1761161461.0,2,0,NTA
1odhcmx,nku9klv,SpaceAceCase,"""I’m the best friend"" your not, plain and simple, people grow, change, grow apart, its possible you see him as your best friend, but he doesnt see you as his best friend. NAH.",2,1761164346.0,2,0,NAH
1odhcmx,nkuramj,grammarlysucksass,"NAH.   This is a really tough but common situation for people our age. I have a few close friends from high school left, people I'd consider my original 'best' friends- and although I deeply love and care for them, unfortunately none of us have the bandwidth to be in touch super regularly. Outside of work, uni, chores, hobbies, it's hard enough for us to balance seeing our partners and local friends enough as it is- let alone long distance best friends. This has meant we get a very small 'slice of the pie' of each others time. It doesn't mean we don't care about each other, it's just so hard to keep up with each other's lives now. Luckily we're all on the same page, so it's bittersweet, but not painful. I think what really helps is carving out proper quality time together once or twice a year, by visiting each other for a weekend or something, or getting an airbnb. Then it feels like back to old times.   Maybe be honest about how you feel you've drifted, without assigning blame.",3,1761169602.0,3,0,NAH
1odhcmx,nkux7sv,Mrtism08,"NTA. People grow apart sometimes. Their priorities change. They might change. Life happens.   You're not the AH for being upset about it, he is your best friend and it's natural to feel hurt or upset when someone you love and care for deeply becomes distant or is not as close as you once were.  He isn't an AH either. Life happens, priorities change, people grow apart. Friendships end sometimes. It's important to understand that it is not a reflection on you.",1,1761171578.0,1,0,NTA
