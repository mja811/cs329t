1ocgptj,nkmfeib,Additional_Day949,NTA: it would have been nice if you called but it slipped your mind. She is also capable of texting you to let you know she wants something.  The cussing is a complete over reaction by your wife.,26,1761063906.0,26,0,NTA
1ocgptj,nkmgptl,capmanor1755,"NTA.   1) Raging and swearing isn't ok in your home. I'd let her cool off then tell her that you need to talk. Insist on couples counseling for the sake of your kids- you don't want them growing up thinking that this is how they should let other people treat them.  2) Prolonged trouble sleeping and irritability can be a sign of depression. The counselor should be able to get her screened, but her primary care doc can as well.  3) If she refuses to go to therapy, get an individual therapsit yourself to help you do a health check on your marriage. If you're in a bad situation you need to consider getting out for the sake of your kids.

1ocgptj,nkmgwsh,EfficientSociety73,"NTA. You were busy and forgot to call. Considering every other time she’s not wanted anything, it shouldn’t be such a huge issue. And I’ll bet she only wanted a sandwich because you DIDN’T call. If you had, the answer would have been no. There is zero reason for her to flip out and swear at you like that. You took a mental load item off her plate and let her rest. Is this how she behaves every time you try to help?",4,1761064361.0,4,0,NTA
1ocgptj,nkmqnb4,heyokaj,"NTA but does your wife normally go off like this about small nothings? Cause let's face it, we pretty much ALL agree this was a harmless accident and she is out of line. BUT... why did she flip her lid? Why did she overreact over something so trivial? This is the question, maybe ask/think back... is there was an underlying issue and this just tipped the scale? Even something as stupid as a bad dream about you. Did you not load the dishwasher last night?   Just feels like this is about more than a text and sandwich.",5,1761067143.0,5,0,NTA
1ocgptj,nkmrnrc,Sea_Register1095,"Why didn't she just text you? She knew what was going on, so why not take the initiative and text you? She sounds rather unhinged to cuss someone out because she didn't get a sandwich. Is she always this much of a bully?",4,1761067426.0,4,0,NTA
1ocgptj,nkmwjvz,Black-EyedSusan96,She is way overreacting,3,1761068787.0,3,0,NTA
1ocgptj,nkmjdli,Lhamo55,"NTA. Let her cool down for a few days, and sit down for a heart to heart. You two should work on identifying the reasons for her sleep issues and emotional imbalance. Let her know how much you love her and don’t want her to be silently suffering. How addressing and treating will be incredibly positive for the emotional wellbeing of the kids. See where that goes, and hopefully much good will come from this.",1,1761065083.0,1,0,NTA
1ocgptj,nkmju47,gloryhokinetic,"NTA. And NO you are not wrong to any extent. Its perfectly ak to STOP offering is someone ALWAYS says no. No, there is something else going on. Is she maybe interested in someone else and is resenting her marriage. That seems way more plausible. Time to investigate. That is if you even want to know.",0,1761065214.0,0,0,INFO
