1odg0z3,nktrcmm,Majestic_Bicycle_272,Time for you to keep things to yourself and might be time to find other place to live but NTA you are an adult and you are contributing your part to bills other than that he doesn't need to know your finances.,20,1761159064.0,20,0,NTA
1odg0z3,nktoley,Sure-Ingenuity6714,Time to fly the nest chief.  NTA   Is dad still paying a mortgage?    The porn habit is irrelevant to this story though!!,16,1761158255.0,16,0,NTA
1odg0z3,nktogs8,lilperform,"NTA, you’re already paying a fair share tho, and the discount is a personal work benefit, not household income. Your dad’s reaction sounds controlling, not reasonable. You’re not wrong for wanting to keep what you earn through your job",8,1761158217.0,8,0,NTA
1odg0z3,nktur1p,srgonzo75,"INFO: I’m not really sure why a 30% discount on electricity is something you’re fighting about. If you get a 30% discount on electricity and pay €700/month in rent and incidentals, why is there an issue?  It would stand to reason that out of the €2100/month pot you have, you’d all have a little more for things needed for the household.   Are you supposed to pay more because you’ve been counting the discount on the utilities as part of your monthly contribution, so you’ve actually been putting in less cash?",8,1761160066.0,8,0,INFO
1odg0z3,nktmn8j,oop_norf,&gt; Now my dad wants me to deposit the 30% discount I get paid for the electricity discount.    I'm not sure I understand this - how can you deposit a discount? Surely the household electricity bill is simply 30% lower than it would be without the discount? In which case everybody would already be benefiting?,8,1761157678.0,8,0,INFO
1odg0z3,nktp1xh,teresajs,"NTA   The only reason you should increase your household contribution is if costs (rent, groceries, utilities, etc...) have increased, and then the increased cost should be shared equally by everyone.",4,1761158388.0,4,0,NTA
1odg0z3,nktpcfm,1962Michael,"NTA.  When it comes to splitting expenses, typically roommates split things evenly.  A couple or a family might split them proportionally by income.   You each put €700 into the account, regardless of your income, like roommates.  This isn't counting the fact that your dad may own the house and so you're getting off cheap.  But there's no reason that you should donate your employee perks while your brother and your dad do not.   Especially since they are getting the benefit of the ISP.   You would be only a ""tiny bit worse off"" on your own, but your dad and brother would be significantly worse off if you moved out.  So you are in a good position to stand firm.",4,1761158474.0,4,0,NTA
1odg0z3,nku09hm,Constant_Host_3212,"NTA, but I'm thinking it might be time to find a different place to live.  You might pay a bit more, but your mental health might improve not living with a verbally abusive tyrant.    Please do look at how the exact way you phrase things might be more abraisive than need be.  ""The door was closed so I closed it again like any normal person would do"" vs. ""I found the door closed so I re-closed it; if you'd like it open I'll be glad to open it for you""  (leave out the ""like any normal person would do"" snark).      I mention this not because you are in any way to blame for your Dad's unreasonable behavior, but because living with unreasonable, verbally abusive people tends to warp our own brains and leads us to start reacting in more abraisive, unreasonable ways that then affect our good relationships with nice, normal, not unreasonable people.",5,1761161674.0,5,0,NTA
1odg0z3,nktp5fh,Novel_Fox,"I'd say NTA given you're already contributing heavily AND they already get an internet discount. BUT YTA for telling them you got the discount. Of course he's going to want it given to the house, that's how selfish people operate. You should kept that info to yourself. Since the cat is out of the bag you have two choices. Say no and deal with the fallout or just move to your own place.",3,1761158416.0,3,0,YTA
1odg0z3,nktotey,pottersquash,"&gt; I said it was closed so I closed it again like any normal person would do  Just FYI, thats an ah way to saythat ""like any normal person would"" sounds like an insult to the asker. It implies your saying they are abnormal for even asking.  To your issue, YTA. If the discount is for electricity, and y'all agreed to share cost of electricity, then the discount goes for all electricity.  ""Your"" electric bill to the company is the full bill. So 30% off the full bill, then the bill sans discount is divided up.",1,1761158321.0,1,0,YTA

1odg0z3,nktz1wm,Viciousbanana1974,You pay the set amount that he and your brother contribute. Why should you pay more? That is ridiculous. Perhaps move out and find a roommate. Your dad sounds unpleasant.,2,1761161322.0,2,0,NTA

1odg0z3,nku35h3,vt2022cam,"NTA- Maybe moving out and getting roommates might be a good idea? There are a lot of conflicts with your father and it sounds like you walk on eggshells all the time for little things. You are worried you might set him off, just by being in the house.
