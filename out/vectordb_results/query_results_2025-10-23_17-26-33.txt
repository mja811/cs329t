=== QUERY ===
I (26F) am getting married to my fianc√© (30M) next summer. My fianc√© has two
younger brothers, one of which is in the wedding party and the other who isn‚Äôt
even being invited.   My fianc√© never got along very well with his brothers
their entire childhood. I graduated with the brother we don‚Äôt want to invite and
he was nothing but a jerk the entire time in high school. After graduation, he
moved to another state and has probably only come home a handful of times, he
didn‚Äôt even bother coming up for his grandpas funeral when he passed a few years
ago. And he would always comment nasty insulting stuff on Facebook pictures of
me and my fianc√©. His other brother improved a lot and we get along which is why
he‚Äôs in the wedding.   My future MIL keeps saying we need to invite the jerk
brother, and damn near everyone is saying to invite him just to ‚Äúkeep the
peace‚Äù. Despite the fact that it‚Äôs our wedding and his parents aren‚Äôt paying or
helping with anything so I don‚Äôt feel like I should take their opinion much into
consideration.   So AITA for not inviting my fianc√©‚Äôs brother to our wedding?

Title: AITA for not inviting my fathers wife to my wedding?

Hello!   So for context, my father met and married his wife in 2019. Back then,
I still lived with them and I tried really hard to get on with her. Like, we
used to be fond of each other for like the first year of them being together in
contrary to my brother whom she really hates because he uses every opportunity
to provoke her (he‚Äôs 23 btw) and I told him like a thousand times to just leave
it be. Eventually, she stopped talking to me and didn‚Äôt care for me anymore. I
didn‚Äôt understand why but I also couldn‚Äôt really bother to dig any deeper
because I moved out soon after (in 2021) anyway. In this timeline, we visited
them a couple of times (they live 7 hours away) and never does she even greet
me. She‚Äôs Orthodox and I always took the time to wish her a Merry Christmas and
Easter and wrote her on her Birthdays. She never does any of that. My fianc√©
proposed to me this year and I FaceTimed my father and told him. Mind you, his
wife was in the same room and she didn‚Äôt even congratulate us!! I talked to my
father about this and he said that because of the language barrier (she‚Äôs from
Ukraine but has been living in Germany for around 8 years) and her stubbornness
she‚Äôs unable to understand. And I was like, yes, but why did it work before she
suddenly decided that she didn‚Äôt like me then? Anyway, we are planning to get
married next year and we were originally going for a wedding without kids. I
told my father and he said that if my little brother (5yo) can‚Äôt come then he
won‚Äôt come as well. I was like, okay, fair, we‚Äôre allowing kids for closest
family then because I can‚Äôt just not invite my father. A few days ago, he was
talking to me about airbnbs and turns out, he was assuming that his wife could
come. I carefully told him that we weren‚Äôt going to invite her because I don‚Äôt
like her and I don‚Äôt want her at my wedding because she makes me feel
uncomfortable. My father didn‚Äôt react very well and he replied that she is his
wife and therefore should be allowed to come and he won‚Äôt be coming if she can‚Äôt
come. I told him that he‚Äôs not coming then and we hung up and didn‚Äôt talk since
that.  Honestly, I don‚Äôt know what to take from all of that. Am I the asshole
for not inviting her?

EDIT: Misspelling in the tittle, i meant "Wedding" and not "weeding"‚Ä¶ and no i‚Äôm
was not high while writing the post üòÇ  I am a videographer and have been for the
past couple of years. I have shot multiple wedding films before, but non for my
close relatives.      My uncle reached out saying he is planning his wedding,
after years, he is finally getting married, and i am very excited to attend...
until he asked me if I could shoot his wedding for free. For free is not my
problem, i would love to do it for free, especially as he is my favorite uncle.
But i have been waiting for the day to come, as we would always joke about him
being alone for the rest of his life (Inside joke in the family :)...), but i
dont want to actually shoot his wedding, as I won't even be able to remember any
of it because of my drive to deliver good work. I even told him that he would
barely see me around as i would be running around the venue trying to get the
best shoots as possible. I don't half ass my deliverables either, so i told him
that it would either be me going full high-grade delivery on the film or not
shooting at all. So AITA for telling him that i don't want to shoot his wedding
film, even tho im qualified and could do it for free?

Title: AITA for telling my roomate that her best friend's fiance is not invited to our parties?
Score: 27
Post ID: 1odnx8i

I (27F) live with my boyfriend (25M) and his sister (27F) who is also one of my
good friends. I will refer to my boyfriend's sister as my roomate throughout
this post, but I wanted to be clear that our lives are more intertwined than
your average roomates. We frequently have friends come over and host parties,
and the vibes are good, EXCEPT... when my roomate's best friend's fiance comes
around. I will refer to my roomate's best friend as R and her best friend's
fiance as J.  J has been a source of discomfort in the friend group since he
started dating R. He has shown many times that he holds bigoted beliefs and he
is emotionally abusive to R, who we care about. Not only that, but R and J
constantly argue, even at these gatherings where we're all trying to have fun.
After months of this, it began to reach a point where all our friend group
talked about was how much they hated J, mostly because my roomate kept bringing
it up in conversation. Even at parties, most of our friends were eavesdropping
on their arguments or complaining about how terrible J was to R, and nobody was
having any fun. Yet, my roomate wasn't willing to stop inviting R and J to
parties because she was worried R would be isolated.  While I understand, I have
been in an abusive relationship before, and was not only very triggered by J,
but also sick of how my roomate's enabling was affecting everyone. I set a
boundary and said I did not want J coming to our parties anymore, and everyone
agreed. My roomate didn't agree, but respected is and told R that J was no
longer welcome.  R then got angry at everyone for not "talking to her" about it,
expressing no care about how uncomfortable they had made everyone. Since then,
they have not been in attendance at group gatherings, and while we were sad that
R chose J over us, we understood. Since then, things have been fine.  It's been
a few months, and my roomate has been repeatedly bringing up how J "took it to
heart and has changed". I don't believe that anyone is capable of changing their
whole personality and belief system in a year, never mind a few months, and have
expressed my skepticism. Recently, my roomate and my boyfriend were both talking
about this, and my roomate mentioned that she had invited R and J to our
upcoming party.   I didn't say anything at the time (my bad, I know) but I saw
this as a boundary violation, and was pissed that my roomate had not asked us
how we felt about inviting R and J beforehand when we had already made it clear
that J was NOT welcome. It took me awhile to talk to my roomate about it because
she gets very sad when she is confronted with anything, and I find her reaction
to be triggering (OCD + guilt = bad combo), but once I worked up the courage,
she just kept insisting that it wasn't fair for me to make blanket judgements,
that I should "give him a chance" and that J has changed. She is not willing to
reinstate the boundary we all agreed upon. AITA?

My wife (25f) and me (27m) are trying to make plans for the holidays and this
year, my wife wants to do Christmas with her family.¬†  Wife‚Äôs family are not
very nice to her. They pick on her a lot. Like backhanded comments that are
supposed to be jokes. Particularly her brothers, but occasionally her dad too.¬†
So I texted her mom (52f), dad (51m), and brothers (22m, 28m, 30m) without
telling her and said that we are excited to be with them for Christmas, but
asked them to please keep their snarky comments to themselves. I told them that
the comments calling her immature, dumb, and annoying are unnecessary and rude
and they really hurt her feelings. Her dad responded that my wife has always
been a bit sensitive and this is just the way things are with siblings.This got
back to my wife because her mom sent her screenshots of the text messages and
she said to please don‚Äôt create anymore drama during the holidays.  Here‚Äôs my
justification for this text:  \- She got a porch goose for Christmas which she
asked for and she was really excited and telling all the clothes she wanted to
make for it. Her brother rolled his eyes and said she was immature. Then she got
really embarrassed and just seemed sad. This happened several more times when
she was opening gifts. When I asked her to show me some of the patterns for the
clothes she was going to make the porch goose later, she just got embarrassed
again and said she didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. (I would like to point out that
she is a full time nanny and housekeeper to 3 kids so even if it were immature,
she has an excuse.)  \- Sometimes her brothers will just randomly call her dumb.
Like at her family‚Äôs 4th of July get together, she and one of her brothers were
going back and forth about roundabouts and he just shut down the conversation by
saying he doesn‚Äôt argue with people who didn‚Äôt go to college and she said almost
nothing the rest of the night, even after we got home.  \- My wife lost a good
deal of weight a few years back, but her family is constantly commenting on her
food choices and how much or little she eats and few months to ‚Äúkeep her on
track‚Äù they remind her that most people who lose weight gain it all back.  In
spite of all this, most of the time her family is pleasant to be around but it‚Äôs
like they just can‚Äôt help themselves and need to make these digs at her. When I
try to or she tries to say, don‚Äôt say that, it‚Äôs always ‚Äújust a joke‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre
reading too much into it.‚Äù It‚Äôs just hard for me to see this happen. When I try
to bring it up to her, she closes down or says that it‚Äôs just how her family is.
I just don‚Äôt want to spend another holiday  watching her try to brush it off.¬†
Now according to my wife, my MIL, FIL, and BILs are all mad at me and according
to them I have already ruined Christmas in October. Maybe I should have left
this up to my wife but I know she wouldn‚Äôt do it.  AITA for telling my in laws
to not pick on my wife?

Title: AITA for changing my daughters middle name

Sorry about the long post guys, but this one has been eating at Me. I 31F and my
husband 34M are expecting our first baby in March. We found out really early
that we‚Äôre having a little girl and are super excited. However, there is the
problem of my mother-in-law for backstory my mother-in-law 57F has some serious
control issues to the point that she hijacked our wedding and basically tried to
make it what she wanted and now has effectively ruined most of the baby
milestones. We haven‚Äôt announced the pregnancy yet she decided to go tell the
family herself when we found out the gender. We told her and told her she to
keep her mouth shut. but it‚Äôs her first grandbaby and didn‚Äôt wanna keep it from
her. Well that‚Äôs where the problem started. We wanted to do a gender reveal
party mother-in-law tried to hijack that event again and forced us to do it at a
location that we weren‚Äôt comfortable with at her sister‚Äòs house because we
stated we didn‚Äôt want to have the party there queue World War 3. She got over
the drama after my husband the saint that he is snapped on her. Now comes
planning for the baby shower once again trying to involve her sister who we have
no relationship with. We asked that the only stipulation we had was that we got
to do the food for it because we are both chefs queue the next meltdown. Now his
father 69m decided to get involved as he enables his wife. Husband and FIL get
into a huge screaming match, because that was our only concession. Well this is
where I may be the asshole. When we found out the gender, we decided on names we
picked something non-familial for her first name and her two middle names were
going to be my grandmother‚Äôs middle name and MIL‚Äôs middle name. Since she has
caused all this drama, I told my husband I don‚Äôt want MIL‚Äôs name attached to our
daughter as MIL has a tendency to be vindictive, cruel and narcissistic. Husband
agreed and we have since decided that daughter‚Äôs second middle name will be my
husband‚Äôs now late grandmother‚Äôs name am I the asshole for changing my
daughter‚Äôs middle name?  Edit for context: I‚Äôm done I will not control my
husband‚Äôs relationship with his parents but I‚Äôm done I wash my hands of them
they will not have a relationship with our daughter and I give not a single
crap. I will not subject my innocent child to that type of manipulation. Abuse,
or behavior, I don‚Äôt agree with her way of being and will not allow that as an
influence on my child. Period. I don‚Äôt tolerate poor behavior from my own family
I will not allow it from his at all. They will get no information at all and
hubs is on my side 100% we hate it has come to that but actions have
consequences
