So recently me and a few work buddies had an altercation with our friend about whether two male friends should text/call each other every day. It’s not that we literally need a daily phone call; it’s that outside of work he never reaches out, rarely replies, and treats any effort to connect after hours like a nuisance. We spend a lot of time talking at work, sure, but that’s because we’re scheduled in the same place. Friendship isn’t just convenience—it’s choosing each other when you don’t have to.

We tried offering compromises: a weekly check-in, a group chat, sending memes, even a quick “you good?” sometimes. He shut it down with “I’m not a texter” and called our expectations childish and “relationship standards,” which felt dismissive and weirdly gendered. We’re not asking for heart-to-hearts every night; we’re asking for basic reciprocity so it doesn’t feel one-sided.

He benefits from the social vibe at work but won’t put in any intentional effort afterward, then mocks us for wanting some. That’s why we’re upset—and why he’s at fault here. He doesn’t have to text daily, but refusing any middle ground and belittling our needs is on him.
