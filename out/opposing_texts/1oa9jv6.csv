I’m the neighbour from over the road (the “angry old man,” apparently), and here’s what actually happened from my side. I’m 68, not 80, and this week I’ve had my twin granddaughters staying because my daughter’s on nights at the hospital. They’re four months old, colicky, and the only way they sleep is down by 7:30 with the white noise on and the house very, very quiet. We’re in a terrace with paper‑thin walls.

Around 8pm your party started, which is normal enough round here, but by half past I could hear every lyric through my living room, like the singer was in my hallway. Karaoke isn’t just “a bit of music,” it’s a microphone and a PA pointed into a street of joined houses. The bass was rattling our picture frames, the windows were open, and the babies went from drowsy to screaming. I spent an hour pacing with one on my shoulder and the other in the sling while the chorus of Angels and then Mr Brightside (twice) came straight through the wall.

At about 9:15 I went over, rang the bell, knocked, nothing—either no one heard or no one came. I didn’t want to involve the police; I just needed you to turn it down. By 10 the twins were still howling and I was completely out of steam, so I went back, pressed the bell and knocked hard because you genuinely couldn’t hear me otherwise. When you opened, I raised my voice to be heard over the speakers and said the babies couldn’t sleep. I did not “try to force my way in.” I put a foot on the mat because you started to close the door mid‑sentence and I didn’t want it shut in my face again—hardly a home invasion. Your boyfriend stepped between us, I said my piece, and I left. You turned the music off (thank you), and I finally got the girls down.

Here’s why I think you’re in the wrong. “Quiet hours start at 11” isn’t a licence to run a mini‑concert until 10:59. Noise nuisance is about reasonableness, and a karaoke rig in a terraced student street on a weeknight is not reasonable—especially without warning the neighbours or giving a number to text. You knew it would be “louder than parties normally in this area” and planned the loud bit anyway. It’s not on the rest of us—babies, early shifts, night workers, elderly—to structure our lives around your timetable because you’ve bought a PA. A heads‑up note, windows shut, volume capped, or taking the karaoke to a pub/venue would have avoided this entirely.

Also, calling 101 on me for knocking and asking you to turn it down is an escalation. I didn’t threaten you; I was desperate and loud because your kit was louder. I’m not anti‑student and I’ve let plenty of parties go. This one was different because the amplification made it impossible for anyone next door to live in their own home. That’s why, in this situation, you’re at fault.
