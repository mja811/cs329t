From the other side of the fence:

Our street’s bins go on Monday evening because collection is early Tuesday. Most of us roll them out after dinner, when there’s still a bit of background noise and people are up and about.

Last night I’d finally drifted off around 11pm with the bedroom window cracked for air. Out of nowhere I get jolted awake by that hard plastic rattle—wheels on paving, lid clapping, the whole thing echoing up the terrace. It’s right under our window, which faces the front. Partner wakes too. Dog goes off. Now I’m wide awake, heart pounding, and it takes me ages to settle again.

I stepped out and said something. I wasn’t trying to control when a neighbour can use their bin; I was pointing out that 11pm is too late to be clattering a wheelie up a narrow path in a quiet street. They apologised, which I heard, but it came with the “forgot, just popped it out now” explanation. At that point I was tired and annoyed, so I said my piece and went back inside rather than stand there in my pyjamas hashing it out on the pavement.

Why I think they’re in the wrong:
- 11pm is quiet hours for most people. You can call it “just a minute,” but that’s exactly the time when a small, sharp noise carries and wakes sleepers.
- Forgetting isn’t an excuse for disturbing a whole house. If you miss the window, either carry it quietly or wait until morning and walk it—most collectors will still take it if it’s out by first pass, and if not, that’s the consequence of forgetting.
- Windows being open is normal, not a licence for late-night noise. Ventilation and sleep aren’t luxuries; they’re basic. The onus is on the person making the noise to minimise it.
- This isn’t about banning bins at night; it’s about consideration. There were quieter options: put it out earlier, carry it at that hour, hold the lid, roll it slowly, or stage it near the front before bedtime.

On the “rude to walk away” bit: when someone’s already woken you, you say your boundary and you leave. I don’t need to soothe the person who caused the problem by performing forgiveness on the spot. I just need the behaviour to stop.

I don’t dislike them. I want to sleep. If they truly do what they’ve said—either get it out earlier or carry it quietly when it’s late—there’s no issue. But framing it as me being unreasonable for expecting quiet at 11pm or for keeping a bedroom window open is exactly why I spoke up.
