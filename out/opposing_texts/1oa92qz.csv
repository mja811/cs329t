I just moved back into my apartment after a year abroad. There are three of us total, each with our own room and a shared kitchen/bath/hallway. I probably should mention I’m neurodivergent (ADHD). My schedule isn’t “typical,” and nights are when my brain finally clicks into focus. During the day I’m slammed with classes/work/errands, and I’m still unpacking and getting my life reset after being away for a year.

When I got back, the shared areas were cluttered and dusty and my boxes ended up in the hallway while I figured out where things go. I’ve been working on putting felt pads on furniture, reorganizing cabinets so we all have space, and, yes, cleaning. I value a clean shared space because we all use it.

One of my roommates is a very light sleeper who goes to bed earlier than me (he calls anything from 11pm–1am “early” for him, but sometimes he turns in even before that). He’s told us before that noise at night bothers him. We try to be respectful, but he also expects the apartment to be near-silent for his entire sleep window, which can stretch to eight or nine hours. In a shared place with three adults on different schedules, that’s a big ask.

The other night around 22:45 I was finishing rearranging in the hallway and wanted to vacuum up the mess—dust, crumbs, and the grit that had collected under a shelf I moved. It was a small area and I figured I could knock it out quickly so no one was stepping on dirt for days. I closed doors to muffle sound and planned to keep it brief. He came out immediately and “confronted” me (his word later) saying it wasn’t okay to vacuum that late because he wanted to sleep and it might bother the neighbors. I said I’d try to be quieter, but I did need to finish because it was my only window that day and the cleaning benefits all of us. I also pointed out that his interest in sleeping is valid, but so is everyone else’s interest in being able to use the shared spaces and maintain them.

We went back and forth. I offered to finish that pass and switch to silent tasks after, or schedule the rest for the first window I had the next day. He basically wanted me to stop immediately and not do anything “noisy” at night at all. He frames it as “late,” but we never agreed on house quiet hours, and he chose to live with two night owls. He often labels normal living sounds—dishes, steps in the hall, a quick vacuum—as “being noisy.” He also throws in “the neighbors” as a reason, but we’ve had zero complaints.

I ultimately stopped as a favor, but he left me feeling like cleaning and setting up my space was somehow wrong. Since then I’ve tried to front-load louder tasks when I can, added felt pads and rugs, and use the soft vacuum head. But the reality is some nights are my only window to do apartment maintenance or finish assembling furniture. I don’t wake him to ask permission to exist in shared areas; I just try to be considerate and efficient.

Why I think he’s at fault here:
- He’s unilaterally imposing his sleep schedule on common spaces without a house agreement, expecting near-total silence for long stretches every night.
- He hasn’t pursued reasonable mitigations for his sensitivity (white noise, earplugs, door draft stoppers, moving his bed away from the hall, a fan), and instead defaults to restricting everyone else.
- He waited until the moment I was cleaning to lay down “rules” rather than setting up a house meeting to agree on quiet hours and chore windows.
- He treats necessary, time-limited tasks that benefit all of us (vacuuming after rearranging, clearing hall clutter) as personal attacks, and uses hypothetical neighbor complaints to shut things down.
- He chose roommates with different hours and then refuses to compromise beyond “don’t do it when I’m sleeping,” which with his schedule is often the only time I can focus.

I’m happy to agree on concrete quiet hours and a cleaning/chore schedule we all sign off on, and I’ve already made changes to reduce noise. But making shared spaces beholden to one person’s bedtime—without offering workable alternatives—isn’t fair.
