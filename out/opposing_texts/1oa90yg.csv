AITA for expecting my adult kid to pitch in when they came over for dinner?

I invited my kid and their partner over because I missed them and thought we could “get dinner and spend some time together.” In my head, that always means the family version of dinner: we pick up groceries together, cook, eat, talk, clean up, play with the baby, the usual. Not a restaurant reservation at my house.

Some context that matters:
1) My kitchen is tiny. Two people can work comfortably, three if someone is on prep or plating at the table, and a fourth can be on baby duty or dishes.
2) My husband absolutely tries to direct traffic in the kitchen. It’s annoying, but in a small space it keeps us from bumping into each other with hot pans.
3) I have bad cramps right now. Not contagious, just painful. Standing too long hurts, but I can manage if someone spells me out on and off.
4) We planned a simple menu so it would be easy if I needed to sit. The idea was that my kid could either do some chopping, stir while I sat, set the table, or handle cleanup—whatever they preferred.
5) They’ve told me before they don’t enjoy cooking. I get it. I don’t expect them to be Julia Child—just to be part of the effort.

They arrived, I started the pasta and sauce, my husband started the salad, our other guest bounced the baby. I asked my kid, “Can you take over the sauce so I can sit for a minute?” They said they were invited to eat, not cook, and that they hate cooking. Then they picked up the baby. Which—thank you—but we rotate the baby constantly and have a bouncer in the dining room. The baby wasn’t the only available job.

I tried again: “If you don’t want to cook, can you set the table and fill waters?” Still a no. “I was invited for dinner, not to be told to help.” I ended up staying on my feet because the food was on the burners and timing matters. Yes, my husband hovered. Yes, the kitchen is crowded. That’s exactly why I needed someone to either (a) take a burner for 10 minutes or (b) do the out-of-kitchen tasks so I could step out.

After dinner, they said I shouldn’t have expected help if I didn’t say so when I invited them.

Here’s where I’m stuck:
- We’re family, not a catered event. If you walk into a small kitchen where dinner is actively cooking and the person hosting is visibly hurting, a minimal “What can I do?” is basic courtesy. That can be setting the table, washing a few dishes, chopping at the dining table, corralling the baby, or stirring a pot while I sit. No passion for cooking required.
- “You invited me to dinner, not to cook it” is a technicality that ignores the reality of a family dinner at someone’s house. If you only want to be a guest-guest, say that ahead of time and we’ll order takeout or I’ll plan for it.
- The kitchen size and my husband’s micromanaging aren’t reasons to do nothing. They’re reasons to adapt—swap to an out-of-kitchen task, humor the “traffic cop,” or take the pan for five minutes so I can sit. There were plenty of non-stove jobs.
- Holding the baby is helpful, but using the baby as the only acceptable job—when others can and did rotate—meant I was the one powering through the cramps.

Clarifications:
- I did ask directly, more than once, for small, specific tasks. I wasn’t vague.
- I don’t expect guests to cook at formal invites. This is family dinner at my home, not a hosted gala. If my kid had said in advance “I won’t be helping,” I would have bought prepared food.
- I wasn’t “refusing to sit.” I was trying to keep dinner from burning while being told “no” to the easy swaps.

I’m hurt that my child watched me wince and chose a semantic line in the sand over ten minutes of pitching in. To me, that’s not about loving cooking; it’s about showing up for your people.

So I think they’re at fault here. Not for disliking cooking, but for refusing any reasonable help, hiding behind the wording of the invite, and leaving me to stand in pain in my own kitchen when there were plenty of other ways to contribute.
