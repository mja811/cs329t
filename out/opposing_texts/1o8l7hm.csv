Context from the other side: I coach at one of the four local waterpolo clubs. For privacy I’ll use the same names: clubs 1,2,3,4. We’re not national teams, we’re community clubs with different sizes and goals. Club 4 (mine) is smaller and very development-focused. We’ve got a lot of U16s and U18s, a couple adults, and we often field mixed rosters so the kids get real game experience. The other clubs have deeper benches and more older players. Between the four clubs we routinely loan players for tournaments so nobody has to forfeit and so more athletes actually get water time. All the coaches are in on this, it’s normal.

After a recent practice night, I was in the lobby finishing facility paperwork and talking to a parent when I heard one of club 2’s newer players chatting up your brand new member. I recognized him because he’d been loaned to us at the last tournament for a few minutes. He was telling the new kid about his first gold medal and basically saying how there are “basically 2 good clubs, club 1 and 2, and the others suck.” He also said we had “half our players borrowed” and that he was faster than everyone on club 3 during warmups, and that he barely played for his own team but still got gold because his team won. He explained he got loaned out because he was the newest one on his team, “least value,” and the other clubs were missing people.

I stepped over and told him that our club will be good, because we’re building, and that in that tournament he was playing mostly against our underaged players. Which is true. We entered so our younger athletes could see real speed and physicality and get that experience. We do that a lot. We are open about it. We also borrowed a few players because we had injuries and exams that weekend. That’s better than canceling and it’s allowed, and it gets kids reps.

Here’s why I think he’s in the wrong, even if he thinks he “just told the truth”:

- There’s a difference between honest and disrespectful. Saying “clubs 3 and 4 suck” in a public lobby where kids, parents, and coaches can hear isn’t neutral information for a new teammate; it’s trash talk. You can talk about relative strength without demeaning people who are literally still learning to eggbeater.

- Context matters. Our roster that day was mostly U16/U18. We put them against older, bigger, faster athletes on purpose so they learn. That’s not us “being bad,” that’s us developing. If a 15-year-old keeper gets scored on by a 22-year-old, it doesn’t make the 15-year-old a joke and it doesn’t make the older player a world-beater.

- Borrowing players doesn’t equal “not good enough to exist.” It’s part of our local ecosystem. Clubs share bodies to prevent forfeits and to spread minutes. Your coach didn’t loan you out because you were worthless; they did it because it helps everyone. We asked for a spare with specific limits so the game stayed appropriate for the level. That’s cooperation, not proof that we “suck.”

- Boasting about a medal you “barely played for,” while putting down the clubs that literally gave you court time, just isn’t good sportsmanship. You benefited from the exact community you insulted.

- Culture matters. That kind of talk teaches a new kid to undervalue opponents and teammates. It undermines respect, and it makes smaller/younger athletes feel like they shouldn’t show up. Our sport survives on volunteers and young players grinding through long practices. You don’t get to stomp on that because you think it sounds “honest.”

- Also, you were saying this loud enough for our U16s to hear it. They go home with that in their heads. That’s the part that made me step in. I’m not going to let an adult (or near-adult) talk down to kids who are doing everything we ask of them.

I didn’t blow up at him. I just corrected the narrative: yes, we had underaged lineups, yes we’re building, and yes we’ll be good. But I do think he’s at fault here. You can be frank about other teams’ strengths without disrespecting people. If you want to “give a new teammate a better understanding of the competition,” try: “Clubs 1 and 2 have more older players and depth, clubs 3 and 4 are younger and developing, but they work hard and can surprise you. Play everyone with respect.”

That’s the truth that actually helps. What he said wasn’t “cold and harsh truth.” It was insecure, shortsighted, and it disrespected the kids and volunteers who keep this sport alive.

So, from where I stand: yes, he’s the one at fault. Not for noticing differences between clubs, but for choosing to broadcast it as an insult instead of as context, and for forgetting that sportsmanship is part of the game.
