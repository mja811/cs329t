We’ve had a rough few months with people letting their dogs use our front lawn as a toilet. I’ve picked up more mystery piles than I care to admit, and my kids play out there. I finally put up a camera that faces the strip by the sidewalk because I’m tired of stepping in it or mowing through it. Not trying to be the poop police, just want my yard to be a yard.

New couple on the block moved in with a medium dog. I’ve seen them a few times—seem fine. Tonight I’m washing dishes and glance at the motion alert. I look up and see their dog nose into our grass, circle, lower like it’s about to go. It’s dark and the angle isn’t perfect, but I see the owner standing there while the dog is on the edge of our lawn. I grab a jacket and head out because 1) I am so over this and 2) I don’t want to miss them and end up venting into the void on Nextdoor like everyone else.

By the time I catch them, they’re at their door. I’m a little out of breath and say, “Your dog pooped on my lawn and you need to pick it up.” Direct? Sure. But I wasn’t yelling or cussing. I just wanted it handled right then, not after a 10-minute argument that ends with “we’ll come back later” and never happens.

She immediately goes, calm voice but hard edge, “I know for a fact that didn’t happen, you’ve got the wrong dog.” I tell her it literally just happened and that I have it on camera. To clarify: I have cameras. I check them for this exact reason. I didn’t mean I had a cinematic slow-mo of the poop exiting; I meant I didn’t come out here on a hunch.

Her partner says, “Let’s go take a look,” which I appreciated—it’s the response I was hoping for. We start walking and I guide him toward the strip with a light touch on his back, the same way I’d direct anyone who’s already heading that way. No shoving, no malice. She hangs back and yells that she has a bag. Great! Then it’s a 30-second fix, right?

We get to the spot, I point at the pile by the edge of the grass, and she shines her phone light on it and starts laughing. Laughing. “That’s not my dog’s poop, can’t you see how hard it is? It’s old.” Look, I’m not a poop archivist. Under cold LED light at night, on dormant winter grass, lots of things look white or dried out. Some dogs on high-calcium diets pass chalky stools. We’d had a freeze the other night—things dry fast. What I saw on video was her dog lowering on my lawn, and what I saw on the ground was poop on my lawn. My goal here is not to win a debate about fecal moisture content; it’s to not have feces on my property.

So I say, “I’m not here to argue with you—just pick it up.” Which is exactly true. I am not trying to litigate whether this specific pellet could be carbon-dated to yesterday afternoon. I’m standing in my own yard, pointing at poop, talking to the people whose dog was just there, with a bag already in their hand. The fast, neighborly solution is to pick it up and we all move on.

She gets mad. She stares me down and says while scooping, “Funny how you don’t want to ‘argue’ but you want to make me pick up somebody else’s DOG SHIT. Where’s the camera footage? Would love to see it.” Meanwhile her partner keeps saying variations of “we didn’t do it, but we’ll take care of it” and tries to de-escalate. He even said something empathetic about how this must be an ongoing problem for me (it is). If the encounter had been just him, it would have been over in a minute. Bag it, toss it, good night.

Here’s where I think she’s in the wrong:

- Keep your dog off other people’s lawns. Period. It’s basic etiquette. If your dog is on my grass, lowering like it’s about to go, you lose the benefit of the doubt. At minimum, redirect. If there’s already poop there, apologize and pick it up anyway. It’s not about blame; it’s about respecting someone’s property. My kids roll in that grass. I don’t want anyone’s dog nose-deep in old poo, then trotting through my yard, then me arguing about whether the poop is “fresh enough” to qualify.

- Laughing in your neighbor’s face at 9 p.m. is rude. Even if you believe with your whole soul that your dog didn’t do it, mocking someone for caring about the cleanliness of their own yard is not a good look. I wasn’t accusing them of a crime. I was asking them to remove feces from my property.

- “Show me the footage” in the moment isn’t realistic. I’m outside with you; the footage is on a device inside. I can and did check later. What I saw on replay: your dog stepped onto my grass and dropped into a squat before you tugged the leash. I cannot see a deposit land because of the angle. Could it be another dog’s older poop? Absolutely possible. But this is exactly why the “not here to argue, just please pick it up” line exists. I shouldn’t have to be a forensic analyst to get feces off my lawn.

- If you’re truly “the bigger person,” you don’t escalate, you don’t throw sarcasm grenades, and you definitely don’t bake passive-aggressive apology cookies with a note saying “you’re still totally wrong.” That’s not setting a boundary; that’s poking a neighbor you’re going to live near for years.

Also: I never “ran up” to attack them. I hurried because I’ve had people duck inside and then I’m stuck deciding whether to knock on a stranger’s door about poop. I didn’t “push” anyone—I guided toward the area we were all already walking to. I didn’t say “I’m right, you’re evil;” I said “please pick it up.” There’s a difference.

When they left, I did what I always do: I went back inside, checked the camera, and sighed. It’s exhausting. This whole thing doesn’t have to be dramatic. Most dog owners in our neighborhood keep their pets to the strip between sidewalk and street and pick up. When someone misses, neighbors help each other out. That’s community.

But if your stance is “The principle is what gets me,” here’s a principle: your right to believe your dog is blameless ends at my property line. If there’s poop on my lawn and your dog was just nosing that exact spot, the neighborly response is to err on the side of making it right without the attitude. Don’t argue. Don’t laugh. Don’t plan a petty note with baked goods. Just keep your dog off my grass and, when in doubt, bag it.

I don’t need an apology casserole. I need to not step in crap on my own property. If that makes me the bad guy, fine. But from where I’m standing (on my lawn, holding a flashlight on a pile), the person who turned a simple ask into a performance about “respect” is the one at fault.
