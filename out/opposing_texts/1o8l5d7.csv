I’m the mom in this situation, 42, on disability for my back and nerve damage, and yes I’ve had a long ugly history with meds that I’m not proud of. That’s not some big secret. What gets left out though is that when my kid turned 18, Social Security cut my household benefit by about a thousand a month, and literally overnight I had the same rent, the same utilities, more food to buy for two adults, and less money. We tightened everything and I stopped asking for extras. I covered their phone, internet, roof, water, heat, rides to work when the buses didn’t run, all of it, bcz that’s what you do for your kid while they’re getting on their feet.

Now they’re 20, finally have a part-time job. The checks are like $400 give or take and change every pay period. I asked for half of every check for the house. Not to punish them, not to feed a habit, but bcz the costs here are fixed and their income is not. It’s the simplest way to make sure the lights don’t get shut off or the rent doesn’t get paid late again. I’m still paying the bulk. The math isn’t hard: rent + power + gas + water + trash + internet is way more than whatever “half a check” sums to. I also didn’t pop up with this until two things happened: my long-time pain meds got cut back (so more out of pocket on other treatments and honestly worse days where I can’t stand long enough to cook) and their friend moved in. I wasn’t the one who wanted another adult here. I said “ok” as long as they contribute. Friend actually pays. My own kid? Doesn’t, and then gets mad I’m asking.

About the food card, we live and eat out of one kitchen. They have $160 in SNAP and I do the shopping most weeks bcz I’m the one who knows what’s on sale, what we’re out of, and what can stretch. Sometimes “name brand” is cheaper with the coupon and sometimes generic tastes like cardboard and no one eats it so that’s not saving anyone anything. I buy meat and fruit bcz we’re three adults and I’m trying to cook meals not just microwave noodles. What goes to waste is the stuff I plan for that no one shows up to eat bcz there’s DoorDash at midnight or the leftovers get tossed after someone leaves them out. Could I meal plan better? Sure. Could they also put their name on the calendar and stop acting like SNAP is a private bank account when we’re all sharing the fridge? Also yes. And for the record, when I use their card it is for the house. I don’t buy junk I won’t feed them. I literally save receipts in a drawer and I offered to sit down and go through them. They won’t.

They throw around “addict” like it’s the end of the conversation. I am in pain every day, I’m on a taper plan, and I am in recovery. I slip. I get up the next day and keep going. But my medical bankruptcy wasn’t some shopping spree; it was surgery, PT, imaging, copays, and the interest that stacks when you pick between rent or a payment plan. The car thing: I’ve got to be able to get to appointments and maybe a part-time desk job later if my back can handle it. My license is suspended for fines I’m already working to resolve and I told them exactly what the reinstatement plan is. People act like needing a vehicle in a city with spotty buses is luxury. It’s not. It’s access. Meanwhile I’m still the taxi when they “miss” the bus.

They say I asked for money two days after friend gave me $400 and then I said I had no cash for cigs or bus fare. That was after the rent cleared and the power bill autopaid and I refilled my non-opioid meds that the insurance doesn’t fully cover. You can “do the math” cherry-picking one payment, but the math that matters is all the bills the day they’re due, not the clump in my hand at one single moment. Also, yes, nicotine. I am not celebrating that. I’m trying to quit. It’s ugly. But if we’re going to judge me for $8 a day while living here for almost free, let’s also talk about the Uber Eats and the vapes and the boyfriend basically moving in three nights a week without paying a dime.

They say they “check if I’m folded like a lawn chair.” Do you know how dehumanizing that sounds? I get that they’re scared. I know I have scared them. But I’m not a prop in their story. I am a person doing her best. I asked them to switch up the narrative: if you’re staying here as an adult with a job and a roommate and a boyfriend around, then you contribute. You don’t get to dictate my entire budget while opting out of the bills that keep the roof above your head. I am not asking for half of their net worth. I’m asking for half of a part-time check until they either go full time or move out. They say “she never asked me before.” Right, bcz before they were a full-time student and I still had that SS money. Circumstances changed.

They’re pregnant now. I found out after they told their friend and their boyfriend, which hurt, but ok. I told them I love them and the baby isn’t a bill, but a baby comes with bills. If you’re having a child, it is even more important to learn how rent works, how utilities work, what a budget looks like, and how to contribute or make a plan to live somewhere you can afford. What I won’t do is bankroll three adults and a newborn on a disability check while being called a “drug addict” every time I try to set a house rule. That’s not me being cruel; that’s me setting boundaries so we both survive this.

They keep saying “I don’t feel comfy paying a drug addict half my paycheck.” You can dress it up in a lot of words, but that’s not a financial stance; that’s a moral judgment with a price tag. If you think I’m unsafe, move out. If you think I’m safe enough to sleep under my roof, eat my food, use the power, shower, do laundry, and bring your friend and boyfriend into my space, then be grown and contribute. You don’t get to pick the parts of adulthood you like and dump the rest on me.

So am I the villain? I don’t think so. I think my kid is using my worst moments to excuse not paying their way, while also adding bodies and bills to my house. They want control over every dollar that leaves my hand but zero accountability for their own. “Half of every check” is not exploitation—it’s a flexible way to make sure bills get paid when their hours bounce. If they want a flat number, great, we can draw up a household budget, list the actual costs, and split it evenly three ways. They don’t want that either bcz then the number is higher than half of a small check.

I will always be their mom. I will help them move if that’s what’s best. I will babysit, I will go to meetings, I will keep working on my health. But I won’t be the free hotel that they tear down online while they’re still staying in the room. If you’re an adult living in someone’s home, you pay your share. If you can’t or won’t, you make a plan and go. That’s not punishment. That’s life.

Edit: For folks asking, I offered:
- Written budget with receipts and due dates
- Flat monthly contribution instead of “half”
- Clear move-out timeline if they don’t want to contribute
- Separate pantry shelf for their SNAP items if that makes them feel better

They said no to all but the timeline. I’m not stealing their food card. I’m not asking for child support. I am asking for rent from an adult who costs money to house. That’s the part they’re leaving out.

Edit 2: I’m in a relapse-prevention program, have a pain specialist, and I gave my kid permission to lockbox meds. I’m not perfect, but I’m trying. What I need from them is either partnership or a clean break, not this halfway where they take the benefits of living here and none of the responsibilities.
