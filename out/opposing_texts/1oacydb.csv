I’m the mom here. I live with my husband, our adult son, and our daughter (F21). A recurring issue between my daughter and me is “hanging out.” She says we already spend time together because we share space, walk the dogs, cook, or do a puzzle or art sometimes. I appreciate those moments, but they’re either chores or things we’re already doing at home. What I keep asking for is intentional, choose-an-activity-and-go-together time.

Today there was a local boat race. I asked her to come with me, she said no. I didn’t go after that because the point was to do it with her, not stand there alone. I told her I’m frustrated because this isn’t a one-off. When I invite her to my things, it’s almost always a no, and there’s rarely a “not today, but how about Saturday?” or an alternative. Now she says I’m guilt-tripping her and that she doesn’t “owe” me time because we see each other every day.

I’m not trying to collect a debt. I’m asking for reciprocity. She’s an adult living at home, benefiting from the stability and support we provide. Part of living together is compromise and sometimes doing an activity you wouldn’t pick because it matters to someone you love. Proximity isn’t the same as quality time. When the answer is almost always no to my invitations, it reads as “your interests don’t matter.” If she had counter-offered, I’d have gladly gone another day.

So yes, I’m upset, and I think she’s at fault here. Saying no occasionally is fine; saying no by default, offering no alternatives, and then calling my disappointment “guilt-tripping” is unkind. Relationships need give-and-take, not just coexistence.
