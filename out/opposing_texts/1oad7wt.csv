I (50F) am the mom in this situation, and my daughter (28F) has just told me she won’t come to my home anymore, and that my boyfriend of 6 years—call him “Fred” (52M)—is not welcome at her house under any circumstance. We live about an hour apart. I moved to his town about 5 years ago after dating a year; my kids (she and her younger brother) were already out of the house, and he still had two teens (then 18 and 16) at home, so logistically it made sense. When I introduced him back then, everyone liked him—especially because, after a long history of really bad relationships, he felt like a calm, steady change. I didn’t know anyone out here and had to start over with a new job, so yes, I leaned on him and his family while I built a life.

About a year or so in, we hit a rough patch. He has jealousy issues from past betrayal, and he said some dumb, hurtful things—questioned my whereabouts, made a few comments about my weight that I shut down immediately. None of this is something I’m proud of or think is okay. But we talked, I set boundaries, he apologized (many times), and we started working on it. We’ve done counseling (couples and individual), he’s made changes, and on the day-to-day he’s supportive. He helped me through a surgery, he’s been present for holidays, he’s helped my grandkids with bikes and school projects. It hasn’t been perfect, but it hasn’t been the monster picture my daughter is now painting either.

Here’s where I own my part: when I felt low, I vented to my kids. I called crying on bad days. Sometimes you just need your family to listen. But me asking for an ear during an argument got turned into “sound the alarm, rescue mom.” There have been a handful of times in the last few years where I told them I couldn’t do this anymore, then after we calmed down and actually talked, I changed my mind. That’s called trying to work through a relationship. My daughter and son decided that because I didn’t follow their plan to leave on their timeline, they’re done “faking nice.” They organized a whole extraction—talked about setting me up back in their town, had everyone looped in—without even pausing to hear that I wasn’t asking for that right then. When I stayed, they took it as a betrayal.

A few weeks ago it flared again. I vented. Two days later, he apologized, and we set new ground rules. My daughter’s response was to ban him from her house and refuse to come to mine. She says it’s because she doesn’t want her kids seeing “mean comments to Grandma.” I get that. I also don’t want my grandkids seeing adults freeze out family members, talk about them like they’re trash, or weaponize access to punish choices they don’t like. The couple of times my grandkids overheard tense words, it was addressed and apologized for, and we made a point to keep disagreements private. She keeps telling me she “can’t pretend to be nice,” but being civil for a few hours so your mom can have a birthday, a holiday, or a backyard barbecue with her family isn’t pretending—it’s maturity.

She claims this is a boundary, but it isn’t. A boundary is “I won’t tolerate X behavior in my home.” What she’s doing is an ultimatum: “Leave him or lose time with us and the grandkids.” She refuses to visit me in my home under any conditions, even if it’s just me there. She refuses to let him ever step foot in hers, even for the kids’ birthdays, even if there are clear ground rules and consequences. She’s retelling my private low moments to extended family and calling him “garbage,” then acting shocked that I said she was being immature and mean. She says I’m “modeling a bad relationship” to her kids, while she’s modeling that love is conditional and that you punish people into compliance. That is not healthier.

I’m not asking her to love him. I’m asking for basic respect for my choices and the reality that grown adults sometimes work through hard seasons. He has never laid a hand on me, never threatened me, and when he’s crossed a line verbally, it’s been owned and addressed. We have structure in place. We are doing the work. Cutting him off and isolating me from my own family doesn’t help; it just makes me feel like I have to choose, and I won’t be bullied into that. If she truly wanted to protect her kids without blowing up our family, there were reasonable options: meet in neutral places, set time-limited visits, spell out zero tolerance for snide comments, step outside with me if tensions rise. She didn’t try any of that. She jumped straight to scorched earth.

So yes, I told her that calling me “immature” for staying and branding him as unwelcome forever was uncalled for. I told her she was being mean. Because she is. She took my venting and turned it into a campaign, and now she’s trying to control my life by dangling the grandkids. That’s not a boundary; that’s leverage. If anyone is at fault here, it’s her—for making this an all-or-nothing power play instead of respecting that I’m an adult capable of making my own choices and asking only for basic civility so we can keep this family intact.
