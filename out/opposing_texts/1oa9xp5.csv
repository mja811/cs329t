My bf & I have been on & off the last year. He used to live w this guy who just moved in w his gf (the OP). I don’t really know her well bc every time I’ve seen her she barely acknowledges me unless I initiate, & even then it’s like a whisper-hi while she’s already turned away. Meanwhile she chats w my bf a lot. It’s not like overt flirting, it’s the constant “oh haha remember that meme” & little in-jokes & shared tastes that make you feel like the third wheel in a room you were invited to. I felt iced out but also didn’t wanna make a scene in someone else’s house.

I told my bf from day 1 that I was uncomfortable. He insisted nothing was going on. Fine. But it kept being the same dynamic: I’d walk in, she’d be bright & talkative w him & then mute w me unless I forced the greeting, then she’d say I never say hi. It’s a weird head game. You can say “I said hi, you didn’t hear me,” but if you actually want to include someone you step toward them, you make eye contact, you introduce, you loop them in. She didn’t. I felt excluded in person & then blamed online for “not saying hi.”

So yeah I reached out on fb. More than once. I told her straight that the vibe made me uncomfortable, that it felt like she & my bf were building a little duo & I was stuck outside. I asked if she could just keep things group-y & not so 1:1 w him when I’m there. She responded w “I’m not attracted to him” & “there’s nothing going on” which ok, but she also said she wasn’t going to stop talking to him at her bf’s house if he starts a convo. That’s not the point. The point is: there’s a basic courtesy when your friend’s partner is present. You include them. You address them directly. You don’t leave them to rot quietly in a corner & then blame their “anxiety” when they don’t chatter back.

She also kept inviting me to “hang w us” but it was always vague or last minute. The kind of invite that lets her say “I invited her” while knowing I probably can’t make it. When I didn’t go, she acted like that proved I was antisocial. If you truly want peace you set up a coffee 1:1, you level, you ask “how can we make this feel ok.” She never did. It was performative invites & then back to the same dynamic.

About the fb thing: I scrolled her page. It was public. I was trying to figure out who she is & what my bf even likes in people. I sent him a post she shared ages ago & asked if that kind of thing is his vibe. He said yeah. That wasn’t “stalking,” it was me trying to make sense of a person who treats me cold & then swears she’s harmless. She flipped it into this huge violation. Then she blocked me. Not gonna lie, that hurt. Imagine telling someone “hey your behavior makes me uncomfortable” & their response is to wall you off & call you petty in private. I did message her on ig after like, why block me? If you’re innocent why can’t we just talk? She unblocked to “explain,” but nothing changed in person. Still the same quiet shade.

Fast forward, my bf & I broke up (again). It’s messy, we both know it. I actually reached out to her because at that point I was like, ok, if you truly think there’s nothing between you & him & I’m just insecure, then fine, help him date someone else. I meant it half-sarcastic, half-serious: either prove you’re not angling for him by treating me like a human & not a rival, or help him move on if that’s what the house vibe is. She gave me this frosty “my bf will check on him” message, which read like “keep your mess away from me.” It’s the dismissiveness. She gets to chat up my bf & share tastes & present as “cool girl,” but the second I ask for clarity she is suddenly “too anxious.”

Now there’s a bonfire at her house w her bf & their friend group. My ex was invited. He asked if I could come bc we’re trying to be civil & we’ve both said we want to fix things or at least not isolate. She said no. Flat no. After all the “I’ve invited her a bunch” talk, when it’s a normal group hang outside w multiple people & I’ve never started anything in person, she bans me. He told her that made me sad & he might not come. She’s acting like I’m the one isolating him when she’s the one gatekeeping who’s allowed near the fire pit.

I get it’s her house. People love saying “your house your rules.” But there’s a difference between a boundary & a power move. A boundary is “no drama, be respectful, if either of you starts, you leave.” A power move is “you, specifically, can’t come at all,” when the only “issue” has been me asking her directly, in private, to stop freezing me out. There has never been a scene, never yelling, nothing. I’ve literally stayed quiet in person to avoid exactly this. She calls me petty for blocking/DMs when she blocked me first. She calls me “stalker” for looking at public posts but then uses those posts to paint me as crazy to the group. She says she’s anxious & that justifies everything. My anxiety doesn’t count.

And tbh, I think what frustrates me most is the double standard. She gets to decide how much she talks to my bf, she gets to control the tone, she gets to label me as insecure when I ask for consideration, & then she gets to keep me out of social things the second it’s convenient. Meanwhile she tells everyone I “never talk to her in person,” but doesn’t mention how she never actually tries to include me like I’m a person worth knowing. If she truly didn’t want problems, we could’ve met for coffee months ago, hashed expectations, done the grown-up “hey, let’s make this feel normal” chat. Instead, I got performative politeness, icy vibes, & now a hard ban.

So from my side, OP is at fault here. Not for having boundaries, but for using them to punish & control the narrative. She created a dynamic where I’m the “jealous girl” no matter what I do: speak up & I’m dramatic, stay quiet & I’m rude, scroll a public profile & I’m a stalker, ask to come to a group bonfire & I’m a threat. She’s not trying to keep the peace; she’s trying to keep control. If you truly believe there’s nothing between you & someone else’s bf, you don’t need to exclude their partner from a backyard hang. You set expectations & trust everyone to be adults. If trouble happens, you end it then. But preemptively banning me after months of cold shouldering? That’s on her.

AITA for thinking she’s the one pushing me out & for wanting to attend a group event without being treated like the villain? Because from where I’m sitting, she’s the one who’s been picking & choosing when I exist, and now she’s acting like I’m the problem because I won’t quietly disappear.
