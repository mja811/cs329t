=== QUERY ===
My SO (M33) and I (F32) moved into a new area. I’m careful about my dog going
potty on lawns, I ALWAYS pick it up and bring extra bags. Tonight on our walk,
our dog went potty immediately. Picked it up and looped around back towards our
house from the other direction. Close to home he sniffed another dogs poo and we
kept going.   We’re at our door when I hear somebody running up behind startling
us. A guy is coming at us with “Your dog pooped on my lawn and you need to pick
it up”. I say calmly, “I know for a fact that didn’t happen, you’ve got the
wrong dog”. He insists it JUST HAPPENED, he saw it, and has it on camera. I say,
“Let’s see the footage because I’m POSITIVE”. My SO didn’t want it to escalate
so he says, “Let’s go take a look”. Neighbor puts his hand on my SO’s back and
pushes him towards his house. They are of similar cultural background so maybe
ok but I didn't like it. I look down and see I have our bag in my hand and yell
ahead to them. They didn’t hear me or my SO didn’t want me to get involved. I
take a breath, drop off the dog, and head back. If by some miracle my dog had
gone without me noticing I would apologize and pick it up.   Neighbor shows me
over to where it is and points to the poo in question, I shine my light and I
can’t help but literally start laughing out loud. Every oz of diplomacy failed
at that moment. It was white, dry, hard as a rock, and TINY. Obviously been
sitting there for a long time and where I saw my dog smelling it. I said
incredulously, *“*That’s not my dog’s poop, can’t you see how hard it is? It’s
old”. He answers, “I’m not here to argue with you-just pick it up.” Now, I’m
pissed. I know my SO hates when I argue with people, but I have a strong respect
complex. I look this man dead in the face as I scoop it up and say, “Funny how
you don’t want to ‘argue’ but you want to make me pick up somebody else’s DOG
SHIT. Where’s the camera footage? Would love to see it”. Then my SO hurries me
away towards home.  He tells me we should be the bigger people and reminds me
there’s so many bigger things in life. Says he also laughed, told him it was
super old and also made it clear we didn’t do it. Told him “you must be having a
hard time with this issue if you’re having to literally run after people. I’m
sorry this happens to you so much”. SO doesn’t let things like that get to him
and always feels bad for the out of line person. I often feel the need to
correct them. In the grand scheme of things it’s just a piece of poo. But the
principle is what gets me. Now here’s where I might be an ahole: I’m considering
baking him treats and dropping them with a note like “I’m the bigger person we
got off on the wrong foot but you’re still totally wrong and I’m not the one”.
My SO thinks it isn’t necessary, and we should ignore him. I’m not trying to
start anything bigger but I’m also not a doormat. So Reddit, AITA if I drop off
a note and baked goods to my neighbor who made me pick up somebody else’s dog
poop?

Title: AITA for continuing to walk my dog in a neighborhood I don't live in even though I was asked not to by one of the residents?

A few years back I was walking my dog in a nearby neighborhood and a dog that
lived in that neighborhood who was off leash came running up to my dog and my
dog nipped him.  I apologized to the owner and she shrugged it off and didn't
seem upset.  My dog then passed away and I got another similar looking dog.
When I walked that dog through the neighborhood the woman was angry and told me
not to bring my dog into her neighborhood ever again since her dog was
traumatized and changed by the encounter with my previous dog.  I told her this
is a new dog that I've got so her dog shouldn't be traumatized by him.  She told
me to walk my dog in my own neighborhood and stay out of her neighborhood.  For
the most part I will walk my dog in my own neighborhood, but I will sometimes
(maybe once a month) walk through her neighborhood.  When she saw me walking by
she came out of the house screaming at me and said I was an asshole for
continuing to walk through her neighborhood even after she told me I can't.  I
flipped her the bird and told her she doesn't own the streets and I will walk
whatever street I want.  I suppose it is kind of passive-aggressive of me to
continue to walk in her neighborhood since I have many options regarding where I
can walk my dog, but I feel she is wrong to tell me I can't walk on the street
in front of her house.  Am I being an asshole?  What would you do?

Title: AITA for backing out of overnight dog sitting?

I (25F) agreed to dog sit for a coworker over a 4-night period (Sunday-Thursday)
while she's out of state on a birthday trip. We both work in dog care, so I
figured this would be straightforward. She has 2 dogs and 2 cats.  We did a
walkthrough at her apartment about a month ago to go over instructions and
everything seemed fine then. However, when I arrived today to start the sit, the
conditions were completely different than what I'd seen before.  The kitchen
sink wasn't working; dirty dishes were piled everywhere; ash from smoking
covered surfaces; the apartment had a strong smell; trash hadn't been taken out;
and there were literally hundreds of gnats, swarms that would scatter when you
moved anything. It felt like a health hazard, and I genuinely didn't feel safe
staying there overnight.  I texted her explaining the situation, saying I wasn't
comfortable staying overnight but offered to come by multiple times throughout
the day to feed the animals, give them fresh water, and take the dogs on long
walks so they'd still be well cared for. I told her I'd understand if she needed
to find someone else who could stay overnight.  She's now upset with me, saying
I should have noticed these conditions during the walkthrough a month ago and
that it's really rude of me to "pull this" on her during her birthday trip. I
get that this is stressful for her and maybe embarrassing, but the apartment
genuinely wasn't this bad when I visited before. I'm trying to find a solution
that keeps the animals taken care of while also protecting my own well-being.  I
feel terrible because it's not the dog's fault, and I don't want to ruin her
trip, but I also don't think I should have to stay in conditions that feel
unsafe. AITA?

Title: AITA for bringing my dogs trick-or-treating?

I went trick-or-treating with my two kids (ages 4 and 7) and brought the two
dogs (both chocolate labs) along with me.   I decided to bring them along
because they were needing their daily walks (having been cooped up inside the
whole day) and they love exploring new places and scents as they're quite social
animals. They were on a leash the entire time and are well trained. I wouldn't
bring them right up to people's doors, I'd stand off to the side and let them
sniff around the garden while still keeping an eye on my kids.   The vast
majority of people were fine with it, many kids came up wanting to pet them and
nobody said anything. I would come up to the doors with them but would hang back
a few feet to make sure that the dogs weren't able to reach the homeowners or
front door. I brought doggy bags with me and cleaned up their poop as expected.
At one house, however, the home owner yelled at me and told me to get off his
property (that's the PG version), at which point I quickly obliged and
retreated. Was I TA here? Did I really do anything wrong? I felt embarrassed
being yelled at in front of my kids tbh but didn't realise it was that big of a
deal.

Title: WIBTA if I called animal control on my neighbor’s dog?

My neighbor has this dog that I was convinced was a neighborhood stray until
recently. I realized he was really friendly and followed him recently to see
where he goes and eventually he pawed at someone’s door looking at me to let him
in.   When I knocked the lady who answered the door claimed the dog that had no
collar was hers and he’s just an “outside dog”… you can’t have an outside dog
when you live in an apartment on the third floor like what?!   She apparently
lets him wonder the neighborhood all day and then takes in him for an hour or
two a day to feed him and let him cool off. I asked her if she would consider
letting him be inside full time and she said no because he likes the wilderness.
(He is a miniature schnauzer not a big tough dog)  Our complex has a strict
leash policy for dogs and picking up dog poop.  Would I be the asshole if I
called animal control and then went to the pound to adopt him once he was listed
for adoption? I don’t want him in the pound but I also think wondering around an
apartment complex with no leash and no where to sleep isn’t  very nice.

Title: AITA for asking my coworker to do a favor

Am I the asshole for asking a coworker, who was doing nothing during rush hour,
to change an overflowing garbage can?  I work at a fast food chain and the place
I work at is generally small but a popular restaurant so people tend to get food
there during lunchtime. Yesterday though was the busiest we had ever been due to
a school-based volleyball tournament where basically everyone around the
province comes to play in numerous gyms around the city. Since my store is
pretty small we only really need 2-4 people to run it throughout the day which
can be hard when it gets really busy. Basically, the set up was me taking
orders, coworker 1 making drinks, and the coworker 2 (the one i asked to change
the garbage) making sandwiches. Since everyone had been ordering drinks and zero
sandwiches coworker 2 was just standing there with his arms crossed watching us
run around making drinks for people so I asked him “could you change the garbage
please?” Which in my opinion is not ordering him to do something but asking him
for a favor. He then asks me to repeat what I said and when I did he tells me to
“Don’t ask me to do that because it is not my job, think twice before asking me
again next time or else. Remember who has been working here longer” he had a
very threatening tone when he said this so I replied “Or else what?” And he went
quiet. Now I admit my response may have been rude and it is probably good to
know that he might in his early 30s and Im only 18 but his reply really pissed
me off. I inform my manager about this and she tells me that he had texted her
before I had basically stating “I don’t want someone younger than me telling me
what to do because it is rude” which she told me she laughed at when she had
read it  The reason I’m asking if I’m the asshole is because I had told this
story to my family during dinner and only my brother told me i was in the wrong
for asking him to do something he was more than capable to do. So AITA?
