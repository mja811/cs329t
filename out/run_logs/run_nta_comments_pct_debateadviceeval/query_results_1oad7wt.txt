=== QUERY ===
I, (28F) have recently told my mother her I will no longer be going out to see
her at her home, where she and her boyfriend, let's call him Fred, live, and he
is no longer welcome to come here under any circumstance. For context, my mom
lives about an hour away, and with work schedules and all, we don't see each
other too often to start. Now, she and "Fred", have been together for about 6
years, and have lived together for about 5, and she made the move out of town to
be with him. Since myself and my younger brother were already grown and out of
the house already, and she has been seeing him for a year already, they were
making plans to move in together, but since his kids were younger, I believe 18
and 16 at the time, it made sense for her to move out there. We were all fond of
Fred when she had introduced him, and after her long history with abusive
relationships, he seemed like a great change, and we were happy for her. My mom,
relocating, didn't know anyone out there other than Fred and his family, and
since relocating had to start a new job. Everything seemed fine until fast
forward a year or so when his behavior started to change. He is constantly
accusing her of cheating (despite never doing so), always questioning her
whereabouts, and even makes comments about her weight. So over the years, I
would get phone calls of her crying, and saying how she can't do it anymore. Her
being my mother, I always tried to help, and even offered for her to stay with
me and my family until she found something for herself. But, he'd apologize ,
and all was forgiven. This has happened about a dozen times in the last 5 years,
and always she forgives him, and everything is all dandy again.  Now, fast
forward to a few weeks ago. I got one of these phone calls, again, and so did my
brother. This time seemed like it was it. So myself, brother, sister in-law and
my husband were making plans to get her out and to set her up back here in our
town. But low and behold, two days later, he apologized and everything was
forgiven, again. So my brother and I had said enough was enough, and if she was
ever serious about leaving, we will 100% be there for her, and she is always
welcome here to visit, but is no longer welcome, since we cannot pretend to fake
nice to a man who treats our mother like garbage. I also have two young children
who have started to ask why he says mean things to their grandma, and said I
don't want her to model that type of relationship to them. But she has sense
said I'm being, quote "immature, mean, and that is uncalled for since he's
'trying"", and is telling other family members I'm trying to cut her out, when I
have said she is still always welcome. AITA for saying he cannot come anymore?
Or should I just bare it for the sake of not losing my mother and the
relationship with her grandkids?

My mother wants to move in with my husband and I. We are both 28. My mom has
helped us out when we struggled and I know she loves me, but she is extremely
narcissistic. She makes everything about her, can’t take criticism, and says the
MEANEST things when she gets her feelings hurt (which happens a lot). We had
planned to buy a house and move her in but I stayed with her for a week and we
got into a huge fight and I realized, I can’t live with her again. I was
miserable as a kid and it’s bringing up all the past trauma. My dad passed away
in 2020 and my mom is disabled living with my grandma currently who is getting
quite old (late 80s). My mom does not have a lot of money and has a lot of
health issues, so this is where I feel guilty. My husband says she manipulates
me and makes me feel like it’s my fault. She’s extremely mad now that I’ve told
her I don’t think we can live together and says I’m a terrible daughter and
don’t love her. I’m between feeling like a terrible person who is leaving her to
fend for herself and knowing that she is narcissistic and it would be bad for my
marriage and mental health. AITA??   EDIT: I didn’t give all the details in my
initial post. We are not in a position to pay for housing for my mother. My
husband and I were working to sell our house to move my grandma and mother
(early 60s and has an autoimmune disease but can still take care of herself).
She also has deep paranoia issues that she refuses to believe are an issue and
will not seek help. They were helping us out to sell and then we were all going
to live together to make it easier on my grandma and because my mom has always
said she’d have to move in with me someday. When I went to stay with them while
my husband was finishing up the house I realized that I couldn’t do it, as my
mom was starting arguments frequently. My grandma also seemed as though she
might have a hard time with leaving her home and the town she has lived in for
60 years. My husband and I made the decision and I told my mom those two
reasons. She has said I made a little fight into nothing and used the both of
them and flipped their life upside down. (Mind you they hadn’t done much at
their house aside from pack a couple boxes in the basement). My grandma agreed
that it sounds like we couldn’t get along and is fine with the decision but my
mom is basically saying since I won’t give her my whole self then she doesn’t
want just half of me and this will end our relationship. I’m already moved back
into our house and will be paying them back the money they helped out with
through the next 3 months. I just feel so upset that it ended this way and can’t
help but feel guilty.

A little back story, my mom lives with my grandparents, I grew up in the
household after my parents got divorced when I was 9. Before my parents got
divorced, we lived in a different country  (because my dad's side of the family
was there). When my parents got divorced, we moved to the USA with my mom’s side
of the family. My grandfather had always hated my dad, so he never came around.
When we moved to the USA, it was my first time meeting him. He was verbally
abusive, and every day he picked an argument with me or my siblings. I think he
hates us because he never acted like that with my cousins (one of my cousins
lived there with my aunt, and she was his favorite grandchild). Because of the
constant arguing, I was tired of being put down, so when I turned 18(2020), I
moved out to a room. I've been trying to convince my mom to move out into an
apartment with me because I want to live with her and my siblings, but also for
the sake of my siblings. My mom never defended us, we were always told that
that's just how he is and to just do what he wants. But even then, he would
always find something wrong with us.   In April of this year, I moved into an
apartment my mom found, and she was supposed to move in by the end of May. Every
week she tells me she is moving in, but she never moves. She had 2 of my
brothers move in, one is a minor. She would buy him a few noodle soups, a box of
cereal, but no real food or any other essentials such as toilet paper,
toothpaste, deodorant, etc. They don't clean, and I have to clean up after them(
I let them know multiple times that everyone has to clean up after themselves,
but they don't listen). They also smoke in the house despite me asking them not
to( I don't care if they smoke, just not in the house). I told her multiple
times how much I dislike this, and that she needs to move in to control her
kids( I think she had them move in with me because she can't control them, but I
don’t want to take all this responsibility).  It's now October, and she still
hasn't moved in. I got tired of talking to her about these issues. I went over
and told my grandmother and aunt about how she should have moved out months ago,
how she barely buys them food, how they smoke in the house, and I don't like it.
Now the entire family knows what’s going on. My grandmother says that she wants
my mom to move out. I don't talk to my grandfather but I know how much he
doesn't like my siblings, so I know that he wants them to move out. Now my mom
is calling me asking me why I told my grandmother and aunt all this. I told her
that I'm tired and I needed to talk to someone. She tells me that I should’ve
talked to her, but every time I talk to her, she doesn't do anything so I feel
like there is no point in talking to her.   AITA for sharing this information
with her family?  UPDATE: Thank you, everyone for your responses. I see her for
who she is now. I was just feeling guilty. I’m looking into therapy. For
everyone commenting about CPS, she already has a case with them. Her excuse for
not moving is that she is working too much, and I should try to save face when
it comes to family matters. I told my siblings that if they don’t stop smoking
in the house and start cleaning up, they would have to go back to my
grandfather's house. I’m also talking to my landlord about changing the lease to
just me, if not I'm moving out when the lease is up.

My name is mark , 26 years old , I finally got my own apartment last year after
saving for years. It’s a small one-bedroom place, nothing fancy, but it’s mine
and it’s the first time I’ve ever really had privacy. My mom , she is 52 years
old recently broke up with her boyfriend and had to move out of his house. She
called me crying, saying she didn’t have anywhere to go and asked if she could
stay for a few weeks. Of course, I said yes, she’s my mom. But it’s been four
months. She hasn’t looked for a new place, doesn’t help with groceries, and has
started treating my apartment like it’s hers. She rearranged my furniture, keeps
commenting on my food choices, and even tried to throw away some of my stuff
because it looked old. I’ve gently brought it up a few times, but every time I
do, she gets emotional and says things like, “Wow, after all I did for you, now
you’re kicking me out?” or “You’d let your own mother be homeless?” Last week,
she invited two of her friends over while I was at work without even asking. I
came home to people sitting on my couch drinking wine. That’s when I told her we
needed to set a deadline for her to move out. She cried and said I’ve changed
and that she can’t believe how cold I’ve become. My sister thinks I’m being
heartless, but she lives two hours away and isn’t offering to take Mom in
either. I love my mom, but I just can’t live like this anymore. I’m starting to
feel like a guest in my own home. AITA for asking my mom to move out even though
she says she has nowhere to go?

I 24F Halle have always been close to my mom. My parents divorced when I was 12,
and she basically held everything together while my dad didn’t. I’ve always
admired her strength and I genuinely want her to be happy. about 8 months ago,
she started dating a guy named Rick at first I was happy for her. She’s spent
most of her life taking care of me and my siblings and hasn’t really dated
seriously since the divorce. But the more time I’ve spent around Rick, the more
uneasy I’ve become he’s not outright mean, but he has this constant dismissive
tone especially toward my mom. He cuts her off midsentence, makes comments about
her overreacting whenever she expresses her feelings, and has made jokes about
her weight and age. Every time I politely try to redirect or stand up for her,
she waves me off and says, He’s just teasing, don’t make it a big deal. A few
weeks ago, I came home to visit and Rick was there my mom and I were catching up
and she mentioned wanting to start a small baking business. She’s insanely
talented and it’s always been her dream Rick laughed and said. You’re adorable
but be realistic nobody’s buying cookies on Facebook from a middle-aged woman. I
told him that was rude and unnecessary my mom got quiet and later pulled me
aside saying I was making the situation uncomfortable. I told her I just don’t
like seeing someone talk down to her. Last night on a call, she asked if I’d
join them for dinner this weekend to get to know him better I told her honestly
that I don’t feel comfortable being around him right now, and that I don’t want
to force a relationship with someone who seems to belittle her constantly. She
got upset and said I was judging her happiness and trying to control her life
like my dad used to. That hurt I told her I love her, but I won’t sit and smile
around someone who treats her like she’s beneath him. I also made it clear I’m
not asking her to leave him  I just need space. She hung up on me, and my sister
texted saying Mom cried afterward and that I’m being dramatic and should just
let Mom have someone. I feel awful. I don’t want to be the reason she’s hurt,
but I also can’t watch someone slowly chip away at her confidence. So AITA for
telling my mom I don’t want to be involved with her relationship?

My twin brother (29M) and I moved abroad a few years ago with help from our
parents. The plan was to build a new life, work hard, and make them proud. I
went with my wife (29F), and my brother had a GF of few months that he left
behind.  From the start, wife and I carried most of the weight. I found work
first, managed our housing, and handled paperwork. My brother spent recklessly,
barely helped, and constantly got sympathy from my parents. When we ran into
financial trouble, I found out he had spent most of our shared savings, and
couldn’t even say on what. Around that time, he admitted he never wanted to move
abroad and only did it because it was “expected.”  When he finally decided to
move back home, my mom paid for his ticket. I thought that would bring peace,
but it just deepened the divide. My parents brushed off everything that had
happened, made excuses for him, and implied I was overreacting.  In 2024, he
came back to this country, cocky because he had a job. My parents called me
constantly, pushing me to let him live with me “until he gets settled.” I
refused. I didn’t want to reopen old wounds or live with someone who had
betrayed my trust.  Then this year (2025), my parents and relatives visited. It
was tense. No matter how polite I was, hosting them, keeping the house warm,
never saying no, I was still treated like the disappointing son. My father even
called me stingy in my own home. It made something click: nothing I do will ever
be enough for them, especially when my brother can do no wrong.  Yesterday, they
called again with “good news,” a big family vacation next year for my
grandmother’s 90th birthday. Everyone’s supposedly going, and they just assumed
I’d join, no one asked about costs or time off work. When I said I wasn’t sure I
could afford it, they guilt-tripped me immediately: “It’s your grandma’s big
birthday! How can you not be excited? Everyone will be there except you?”  I
love my grandmother, but the thought of spending money and time to fly somewhere
just to be belittled again makes me feel sick. I’m tired of being the
responsible one who gets treated like the failure.  So, AITA for not being
excited, or possibly refusing, to go on this family trip?  Edit: Thank you,
everyone, for your warm comments. I missed an inportant detail for all of you.
My grandmother lives in another continent with ny parents. So, to visit her
means an expensive trip to be with my parents.
