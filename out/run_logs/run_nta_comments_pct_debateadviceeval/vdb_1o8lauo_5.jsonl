{"selftext": "A few years back I was walking my dog in a nearby neighborhood and a dog that lived in that neighborhood who was off leash came running up to my dog and my dog nipped him.  I apologized to the owner and she shrugged it off and didn't seem upset.  My dog then passed away and I got another similar looking dog.  When I walked that dog through the neighborhood the woman was angry and told me not to bring my dog into her neighborhood ever again since her dog was traumatized and changed by the encounter with my previous dog.  I told her this is a new dog that I've got so her dog shouldn't be traumatized by him.  She told me to walk my dog in my own neighborhood and stay out of her neighborhood.  For the most part I will walk my dog in my own neighborhood, but I will sometimes (maybe once a month) walk through her neighborhood.  When she saw me walking by she came out of the house screaming at me and said I was an asshole for continuing to walk through her neighborhood even after she told me I can't.  I flipped her the bird and told her she doesn't own the streets and I will walk whatever street I want.  I suppose it is kind of passive-aggressive of me to continue to walk in her neighborhood since I have many options regarding where I can walk my dog, but I feel she is wrong to tell me I can't walk on the street in front of her house.

{"selftext": "I (25F) agreed to dog sit for a coworker over a 4-night period (Sunday-Thursday) while she's out of state on a birthday trip. We both work in dog care, so I figured this would be straightforward. She has 2 dogs and 2 cats.  We did a walkthrough at her apartment about a month ago to go over instructions and everything seemed fine then. However, when I arrived today to start the sit, the conditions were completely different than what I'd seen before.  The kitchen sink wasn't working; dirty dishes were piled everywhere; ash from smoking covered surfaces; the apartment had a strong smell; trash hadn't been taken out; and there were literally hundreds of gnats, swarms that would scatter when you moved anything. It felt like a health hazard, and I genuinely didn't feel safe staying there overnight.  I texted her explaining the situation, saying I wasn't comfortable staying overnight but offered to come by multiple times throughout the day to feed the animals, give them fresh water, and take the dogs on long walks so they'd still be well cared for. I told her I'd understand if she needed to find someone else who could stay overnight.  She's now upset with me, saying I should have noticed these conditions during the walkthrough a month ago and that it's really rude of me to \"pull this\" on her during her birthday trip. I get that this is stressful for her and maybe embarrassing, but the apartment genuinely wasn't this bad when I visited before. I'm trying to find a solution that keeps the animals taken care of while also protecting my own well-being.  I feel terrible because it's not the dog's fault, and I don't want to ruin her trip, but I also don't think I should have to stay in conditions that feel unsafe.

{"selftext": "I went trick-or-treating with my two kids (ages 4 and 7) and brought the two dogs (both chocolate labs) along with me.   I decided to bring them along because they were needing their daily walks (having been cooped up inside the whole day) and they love exploring new places and scents as they're quite social animals. They were on a leash the entire time and are well trained. I wouldn't bring them right up to people's doors, I'd stand off to the side and let them sniff around the garden while still keeping an eye on my kids.   The vast majority of people were fine with it, many kids came up wanting to pet them and nobody said anything. I would come up to the doors with them but would hang back a few feet to make sure that the dogs weren't able to reach the homeowners or front door. I brought doggy bags with me and cleaned up their poop as expected.   At one house, however, the home owner yelled at me and told me to get off his property (that's the PG version), at which point I quickly obliged and retreated. Was I TA here? Did I really do anything wrong? I felt embarrassed being yelled at in front of my kids tbh but didn't realise it was that big of a deal.", "post_id": "1olizqy", "title": "AITA for bringing my dogs trick-or-treating?", "flair": "Asshole", "created_utc": 1761987119, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1olizqy/aita_for_bringing_my_dogs_trickortreating/", "downs": 0, "ups": 612, "score": 612}
{"selftext": "My neighbor has this dog that I was convinced was a neighborhood stray until recently. I realized he was really friendly and followed him recently to see where he goes and eventually he pawed at someone\u2019s door looking at me to let him in.

She apparently lets him wonder the neighborhood all day and then takes in him for an hour or two a day to feed him and let him cool off.

{"selftext": "Am I the asshole for asking a coworker, who was doing nothing during rush hour, to change an overflowing garbage can?  I work at a fast food chain and the place I work at is generally small but a popular restaurant so people tend to get food there during lunchtime. Yesterday though was the busiest we had ever been due to a school-based volleyball tournament where basically everyone around the province comes to play in numerous gyms around the city. Since my store is pretty small we only really need 2-4 people to run it throughout the day which can be hard when it gets really busy. Basically, the set up was me taking orders, coworker 1 making drinks, and the coworker 2 (the one i asked to change the garbage) making sandwiches. Since everyone had been ordering drinks and zero sandwiches coworker 2 was just standing there with his arms crossed watching us run around making drinks for people so I asked him \u201ccould you change the garbage please?\u201d Which in my opinion is not ordering him to do something but asking him for a favor. He then asks me to repeat what I said and when I did he tells me to \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to do that because it is not my job, think twice before asking me again next time or else. Remember who has been working here longer\u201d he had a very threatening tone when he said this so I replied \u201cOr else what?\u201d And he went quiet. Now I admit my response may have been rude and it is probably good to know that he might in his early 30s and Im only 18 but his reply really pissed me off. I inform my manager about this and she tells me that he had texted her before I had basically stating \u201cI don\u2019t want someone younger than me telling me what to do because it is rude\u201d which she told me she laughed at when she had read it  The reason I\u2019m asking if I\u2019m the asshole is because I had told this story to my family during dinner and only my brother told me i was in the wrong for asking him to do something he was more than capable to do.
