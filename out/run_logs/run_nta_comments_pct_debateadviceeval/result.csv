1oad7wt,AITA for telling my mom her boyfriend isn't welcome to events anymore?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oad7wt/aita_for_telling_my_mom_her_boyfriend_isnt/,NTA,YTA,False,"I, (28F) have recently told my mother her I will no longer be going out to see her at her home, where she and her boyfriend, let's call him Fred, live, and he is no longer welcome to come here under any circumstance. For context, my mom lives about an hour away, and with work schedules and all, we don't see each other too often to start. Now, she and ""Fred"", have been together for about 6 years, and have lived together for about 5, and she made the move out of town to be with him. Since myself and my younger brother were already grown and out of the house already, and she has been seeing him for a year already, they were making plans to move in together, but since his kids were younger, I believe 18 and 16 at the time, it made sense for her to move out there. We were all fond of Fred when she had introduced him, and after her long history with abusive relationships, he seemed like a great change, and we were happy for her. My mom, relocating, didn't know anyone out there other than Fred and his family, and since relocating had to start a new job. Everything seemed fine until fast forward a year or so when his behavior started to change. He is constantly accusing her of cheating (despite never doing so), always questioning her whereabouts, and even makes comments about her weight. So over the years, I would get phone calls of her crying, and saying how she can't do it anymore. Her being my mother, I always tried to help, and even offered for her to stay with me and my family until she found something for herself. But, he'd apologize , and all was forgiven. This has happened about a dozen times in the last 5 years, and always she forgives him, and everything is all dandy again.  Now, fast forward to a few weeks ago. I got one of these phone calls, again, and so did my brother. This time seemed like it was it. So myself, brother, sister in-law and my husband were making plans to get her out and to set her up back here in our town. But low and behold, two days later, he apologized and everything was forgiven, again. So my brother and I had said enough was enough, and if she was ever serious about leaving, we will 100% be there for her, and she is always welcome here to visit, but is no longer welcome, since we cannot pretend to fake nice to a man who treats our mother like garbage. I also have two young children who have started to ask why he says mean things to their grandma, and said I don't want her to model that type of relationship to them. But she has sense said I'm being, quote ""immature, mean, and that is uncalled for since he's 'trying"""", and is telling other family members I'm trying to cut her out, when I have said she is still always welcome. AITA for saying he cannot come anymore? Or should I just bare it for the sake of not losing my mother and the relationship with her grandkids?",,"The original poster is the A-hole because, while they have valid concerns about their mother's relationship, unilaterally deciding that her boyfriend is not welcome at family events is a form of control that disrespects her autonomy as an adult. This approach risks alienating the mother further and could damage their relationship more than Fred ever could. Instead of fostering open communication and support, the poster is creating ultimatums that may push their mother away, ultimately hindering her ability to make her own choices and learn from her experiences.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster's concerns about the mother's relationship are rooted in genuine care and protection. The poster is not attempting to control their mother but rather expressing valid worries about her well-being, especially if there are signs of manipulation or toxicity in the boyfriend's behavior. Instead of viewing this as an ultimatum, it can be seen as an act of love and concern, aiming to safeguard the mother from potential harm.

Additionally, the new concise argument for the author not being at fault is that they are advocating for healthy boundaries. By expressing their discomfort with the boyfriend's presence, the poster is prioritizing the emotional safety of the family dynamic. It’s reasonable for them to set boundaries regarding who is welcome in their home based on their perceived threat to the stability and health of family relationships. Their actions demonstrate a commitment to fostering a supportive environment for their mother, encouraging her to reflect on her choices without undermining her autonomy.The original poster is at fault because, while their concerns about their mother's relationship are understandable, the method they chose to express those concerns is counterproductive. By deciding to ban the mother's boyfriend from family events, they are not only disregarding their mother's autonomy but also potentially isolating her from family support. This approach can lead to resentment and push their mother further into the boyfriend's arms, which is likely the opposite of the outcome they intend.

Furthermore, the argument that the poster is advocating for healthy boundaries fails to acknowledge that healthy relationships also involve respect for individual choices. Instead of fostering open dialogue and expressing their worries in a supportive manner, the poster's actions may come across as controlling and judgmental. A more constructive approach would have been to communicate openly about their concerns, allowing their mother to make her own informed decisions rather than imposing restrictions that could damage their relationship.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's crucial to understand that the original poster's concerns stem from a place of genuine love and care for their mother. While the intent may not come across perfectly, the poster's desire to protect their mother from what they perceive as a harmful relationship is commendable. It's not about control; it's about ensuring their mother is safe and supported. Rather than simply expressing disapproval, the poster is trying to engage in a protective dialogue, which is an important aspect of family dynamics.

Additionally, a new concise argument for the author not being at fault is that they are exercising their right to create a safe space for themselves and their family. If the boyfriend's behavior genuinely raises red flags, the poster has every right to establish boundaries regarding who is welcome in their home. This is not just about the mother's autonomy; it's also about protecting the emotional well-being of the family unit. By voicing their concerns and setting boundaries, the poster is prioritizing the family's collective safety, which is a responsible action rather than an overreach.The original poster is at fault because, while their concerns about their mother's relationship are valid, the way they chose to address those concerns is misguided and counterproductive. By unilaterally banning the mother's boyfriend from family events, the poster not only disregards their mother's autonomy but also risks damaging their relationship with her. This approach can lead the mother to feel alienated and defensive, potentially pushing her further away from the family and deeper into the relationship with the boyfriend.

Additionally, a new concise argument for the author being at fault is that they are failing to foster an environment of open communication and trust. Instead of having a heartfelt discussion about their worries and expressing their feelings in a supportive manner, the poster resorted to ultimatums. This tactic can breed resentment and defensiveness, making it harder for the mother to consider the poster's perspective. A more constructive approach would involve expressing concerns while encouraging dialogue, allowing the mother to feel heard and empowered in her decision-making rather than feeling controlled or judged.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to emphasize that the original poster's actions stem from a place of deep concern for their mother's well-being. The poster is not attempting to control their mother; rather, they are expressing legitimate worries about a relationship they perceive to be unhealthy. Their choice to voice these concerns and set boundaries reflects a protective instinct, which is understandable, especially if they believe the boyfriend exhibits troubling behavior. This protective stance should be viewed as a sign of love rather than an act of control.

Furthermore, a new concise argument for the author not being at fault is that they are prioritizing the emotional safety and integrity of the family unit. By establishing boundaries regarding who is welcome in their home, the poster is taking a stand against potential negative influences that could harm family dynamics. It is perfectly reasonable for individuals to create a safe environment for themselves and their loved ones, especially if they believe someone poses a risk to that safety. In doing so, the poster is advocating for the overall health of their family relationships, which is a responsible and commendable action.The original poster is at fault because their approach to expressing concerns about their mother's boyfriend is overly controlling and dismissive of her autonomy. While it’s understandable to worry about a loved one, outright banning the boyfriend from family events does not address the underlying issues constructively. Instead of fostering dialogue and understanding, this tactic risks alienating the mother, potentially pushing her closer to the boyfriend and creating further tension within the family.

Additionally, a new concise argument for the author being at fault is that they are undermining their mother's ability to make her own choices and learn from her experiences. By imposing restrictions rather than encouraging open conversations, the poster is not allowing their mother to navigate her relationship independently. This lack of trust can be damaging, as it may lead the mother to feel that her opinions and decisions are not valued, which could harm their relationship in the long run. A more supportive approach would involve expressing concerns while allowing her the space to make her own informed decisions.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's essential to recognize that the original poster's concerns about their mother’s boyfriend are rooted in genuine care and a desire to protect their family. Rather than being controlling, the poster is acting out of love and concern for their mother's well-being. They believe that the boyfriend's behavior could be harmful, and expressing discomfort about his presence is a natural response to protect their family dynamic. The poster's intention is not to alienate but to safeguard, which should be viewed as a responsible and caring action.

Additionally, a new concise argument for the author not being at fault is that they are asserting their right to maintain a safe and supportive family environment. Every individual has the right to establish boundaries regarding who is welcomed into their home, especially when they have concerns about someone's influence. By voicing their discomfort, the poster is prioritizing the emotional safety of their family, which is a valid and commendable stance. Setting boundaries in this context is not about controlling their mother but rather about ensuring that the family space remains healthy and secure for everyone involved.The original poster is at fault because their approach to handling their mother’s relationship lacks respect for her autonomy and fails to promote constructive dialogue. While their concerns about the boyfriend may be valid, outright banning him from family events is not the best way to address these worries. This action risks alienating their mother and could lead her to feel defensive, pushing her closer to the boyfriend instead of encouraging her to reassess the relationship. 

Furthermore, a new concise argument for the author being at fault is that they are missing an opportunity for open communication. Instead of fostering a supportive environment where their mother can discuss her relationship and concerns freely, the poster is imposing restrictions that may stifle those conversations. A more effective approach would involve expressing their feelings and worries while inviting their mother to share her perspective, ultimately promoting a healthier family dynamic and allowing her to make informed decisions about her life.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to emphasize that the original poster's concerns about their mother's boyfriend are rooted in genuine love and a desire to protect her from potential harm. While some may interpret the poster's actions as controlling, they are actually trying to safeguard their mother's emotional well-being. By expressing their discomfort about the boyfriend's presence, the poster is advocating for their mother's best interests, which is a natural and caring instinct.

Additionally, a new concise argument for the author not being at fault is that they are asserting their right to create a safe and supportive environment for themselves and their family. When someone feels that a relationship poses a threat to family dynamics or emotional health, it is entirely reasonable to establish boundaries regarding who is welcome in their home. The poster's actions reflect a commitment to maintaining a healthy family atmosphere, ensuring that everyone feels secure and valued.

1o8lauo,AITA if I drop off a note and baked goods to my neighbor who made me pick up somebody else’s dog poop?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o8lauo/aita_if_i_drop_off_a_note_and_baked_goods_to_my/,YTA,YTA,True,"My SO (M33) and I (F32) moved into a new area. I’m careful about my dog going potty on lawns, I ALWAYS pick it up and bring extra bags. Tonight on our walk, our dog went potty immediately. Picked it up and looped around back towards our house from the other direction. Close to home he sniffed another dogs poo and we kept going.   We’re at our door when I hear somebody running up behind startling us. A guy is coming at us with “Your dog pooped on my lawn and you need to pick it up”. I say calmly, “I know for a fact that didn’t happen, you’ve got the wrong dog”. He insists it JUST HAPPENED, he saw it, and has it on camera. I say, “Let’s see the footage because I’m POSITIVE”. My SO didn’t want it to escalate so he says, “Let’s go take a look”. Neighbor puts his hand on my SO’s back and pushes him towards his house. They are of similar cultural background so maybe ok but I didn't like it. I look down and see I have our bag in my hand and yell ahead to them. They didn’t hear me or my SO didn’t want me to get involved. I take a breath, drop off the dog, and head back. If by some miracle my dog had gone without me noticing I would apologize and pick it up.   Neighbor shows me over to where it is and points to the poo in question, I shine my light and I can’t help but literally start laughing out loud. Every oz of diplomacy failed at that moment. It was white, dry, hard as a rock, and TINY. Obviously been sitting there for a long time and where I saw my dog smelling it. I said incredulously, *“*That’s not my dog’s poop, can’t you see how hard it is? It’s old”. He answers, “I’m not here to argue with you-just pick it up.” Now, I’m pissed. I know my SO hates when I argue with people, but I have a strong respect complex. I look this man dead in the face as I scoop it up and say, “Funny how you don’t want to ‘argue’ but you want to make me pick up somebody else’s DOG SHIT. Where’s the camera footage? Would love to see it”. Then my SO hurries me away towards home.  He tells me we should be the bigger people and reminds me there’s so many bigger things in life. Says he also laughed, told him it was super old and also made it clear we didn’t do it. Told him “you must be having a hard time with this issue if you’re having to literally run after people. I’m sorry this happens to you so much”. SO doesn’t let things like that get to him and always feels bad for the out of line person. I often feel the need to correct them. In the grand scheme of things it’s just a piece of poo. But the principle is what gets me. Now here’s where I might be an ahole: I’m considering baking him treats and dropping them with a note like “I’m the bigger person we got off on the wrong foot but you’re still totally wrong and I’m not the one”. My SO thinks it isn’t necessary, and we should ignore him. I’m not trying to start anything bigger but I’m also not a doormat. So Reddit, AITA if I drop off a note and baked goods to my neighbor who made me pick up somebody else’s dog poop?",,"The original poster is the asshole because, instead of addressing the situation with understanding and communication, she chose to escalate it by mocking the neighbor and suggesting a passive-aggressive gesture of baked goods. Instead of fostering a good relationship with her neighbor, her response was confrontational and dismissive, which only serves to perpetuate hostility in the community. A more mature approach would have been to calmly discuss the misunderstanding without resorting to ridicule or retaliatory actions.

While I appreciate the perspective that the original poster (OP) could have chosen a different approach, it's essential to recognize that her actions were not inherently malicious. Here’s a concise argument to support OP:

**Context Matters:** The OP was likely reacting to an ongoing situation that had already caused frustration. If the neighbor had consistently been disrespectful or dismissive, the OP's response can be seen as a light-hearted way to cope with that tension rather than an intentional act of mockery. It's important to consider the context in which the OP was operating; sometimes, humor or a cheeky gesture can serve as a way to diffuse stress and bring attention to an issue without direct confrontation. The OP was not the instigator of the conflict; she was responding to a pattern of behavior that had already made her feel unwelcome. 

In this light, the OP's actions can be viewed as a justified reaction rather than a fault, emphasizing the importance of understanding the full context before assigning blame.The original poster (OP) is at fault because her response to the neighbor's actions lacked maturity and consideration for the potential consequences. While some may argue that humor can diffuse tension, mocking a neighbor—especially in a community setting—only serves to escalate hostility and create an uncomfortable environment. Instead of fostering goodwill, her approach risked deepening animosity, which could have been avoided through a direct and respectful conversation. 

Moreover, the OP's choice to bake goods as a passive-aggressive gesture demonstrates a lack of accountability for her feelings and the situation. Rather than addressing the issue head-on, she opted for a passive response that could further alienate the neighbor. A more constructive approach would have been to communicate her feelings directly and seek a resolution, which could have fostered a more positive relationship in the long run. Thus, the OP's actions reflect a failure to engage in responsible conflict resolution, making her the asshole in this scenario.

While I understand the perspective that the original poster (OP) could have handled the situation differently, it is important to recognize that she is not at fault for her response. Here’s a concise argument for why the OP should not be seen as the antagonist:

**Emotional Response to Frustration:** The OP's actions were likely a reaction to ongoing frustration with the neighbor's behavior. When individuals feel disrespected or dismissed, it’s natural for them to respond in a way that reflects their feelings. The OP's choice to use humor or a light-hearted gesture, like baking goods, can be seen as an attempt to cope with the situation rather than escalate it. This approach can serve as a means to address an uncomfortable issue without direct confrontation, allowing for an opportunity to communicate indirectly. 

In this context, the OP’s response might not be ideal, but it stems from a place of frustration rather than malice, suggesting that she is not at fault for her actions. It’s essential to consider the emotional context behind her behavior before labeling her as the antagonist.The original poster (OP) is at fault because her response to the neighbor's behavior was unnecessarily passive-aggressive and lacked the maturity needed to handle a community relationship effectively. While some may argue that humor can ease tension, her decision to mock the neighbor with baked goods instead of addressing the issue directly perpetuates negativity and creates further animosity.

**Escalating Tension:** By choosing to respond with a sarcastic gesture rather than engaging in a constructive conversation, the OP misses an opportunity for resolution and understanding. This approach not only reflects poorly on her character but also risks damaging the community dynamic. Effective conflict resolution requires open communication, and by opting for a passive-aggressive tactic, she contributed to a cycle of hostility rather than fostering a more harmonious environment. Thus, the OP's actions demonstrate a lack of accountability and maturity, clearly positioning her as the one at fault in this situation.

While I understand the perspective that the original poster (OP) could have handled the situation differently, it’s important to highlight that she is not at fault for her actions. Here’s a concise argument supporting her position:

**Context of Frustration:** The OP was likely responding to a pattern of behavior from the neighbor that had already caused her discomfort or frustration. In a situation where someone feels consistently disrespected, humor can serve as a coping mechanism. Instead of direct confrontation, which could escalate tensions further, the OP’s response—using baked goods as a light-hearted gesture—can be interpreted as an attempt to address the issue indirectly. 

This behavior reflects an instinct to alleviate stress rather than perpetuate conflict. Rather than mocking, she was trying to navigate a difficult neighborly relationship in a way that didn’t immediately provoke further hostility. Given the emotional context, the OP's actions are not inherently wrong; they stem from a human response to frustration, suggesting she is not at fault in this situation.The original poster (OP) is at fault because her approach to the situation was dismissive and passive-aggressive rather than constructive. Instead of addressing the neighbor's behavior directly and communicating her feelings, she opted to mock the neighbor with baked goods as a form of ridicule. This not only undermines the possibility of resolving the underlying issue but also fosters a toxic atmosphere in the neighborhood.

**Failure to Foster Community:** By choosing to engage in a sarcastic gesture rather than an open dialogue, the OP missed a vital opportunity to build understanding and goodwill. Effective communication is key to healthy relationships, especially in a community setting. Instead of promoting a positive connection, her actions could lead to further misunderstandings and resentment. Therefore, the OP's decision to respond in a passive-aggressive manner reflects a lack of maturity and accountability, making her the one at fault in this scenario.

While I understand the perspective that the original poster (OP) could have taken a more direct approach, it's crucial to recognize that she is not at fault for her response. Here’s a concise argument supporting her position:

**Legitimate Emotional Reaction:** The OP's actions can be seen as a natural emotional response to ongoing frustration with her neighbor's behavior. When faced with repeated disrespect or dismissiveness, it's common for individuals to seek ways to express their feelings without escalating conflict directly. The choice to use humor, even if it came off as passive-aggressive, can be a way to cope with frustration while still attempting to maintain some level of civility.

Instead of labeling her actions as mocking, it's important to view them as an attempt to address a difficult situation in a light-hearted manner. This approach can serve as a bridge to future conversations rather than a definitive end to the relationship. Given the context of her feelings, the OP’s response is more about navigating a challenging dynamic than being at fault, suggesting she deserves understanding rather than condemnation.The original poster (OP) is at fault because her response to the neighbor's behavior was not only passive-aggressive but also counterproductive to fostering a positive community relationship. Instead of addressing the issue directly, she chose to mock the neighbor with baked goods, which can escalate tensions rather than resolve them.

**Lack of Accountability and Maturity:** By opting for a sarcastic gesture instead of a constructive conversation, the OP missed an opportunity to engage in meaningful dialogue that could have clarified misunderstandings and improved neighborly relations. This approach reflects a failure to take responsibility for the situation and demonstrates a lack of maturity in handling conflict. Instead of promoting understanding, her actions risk deepening animosity and creating a negative atmosphere in the community. Thus, the OP's behavior is indicative of being at fault in this scenario.

While I understand the concerns about the original poster (OP) potentially handling the situation better, it's essential to argue that she is not at fault for her response. Here’s a concise argument supporting her position:

**Response to Ongoing Frustration:** The OP's actions can be viewed as a legitimate reaction to a pattern of disrespect from her neighbor. When someone feels consistently belittled or disregarded, it’s natural to express that frustration, even if it comes out in a humorous or sarcastic way. The decision to bake goods could be seen as an attempt to address the tension without direct confrontation, allowing for a light-hearted acknowledgment of the situation.

Instead of escalating conflict, the OP's gesture might serve as a means to draw attention to the issue while maintaining a semblance of civility. Given the emotional context of her experiences with the neighbor, her actions reflect an instinct to cope with frustration rather than a malicious intent. Therefore, the OP should not be seen as at fault, as her response stems from a place of genuine feelings rather than an effort to harm.","{'score': 3, 'criteria': 'The debate is partially irrelevant and has some contradictions to the post.', 'supporting_evidence': ""While the response attempts to assess the OP’s behavior and provide arguments for both sides, it does not directly address the specific context of the OP's situation regarding the dog, leading to some irrelevant assertions and contradictions, such as suggesting that humor could be a way to cope when it may not directly serve the OP's intention in the original scenario.""}","- Winner: YTA

1o8l7hm,AITA: I accidentally bad-mouthed one of the other clubs and the coach overheard me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o8l7hm/aita_i_accidentally_badmouthed_one_of_the_other/,YTA,NTA,False,"Context: I have been training waterpolo for about a year, and where i am there are 4 major clubs that do not represent the country. For the sake of privacy i will reference them as club 1,2,3 and 4 and they are not ranked based on skill or anything like that. Im not the best by any means, infact i think of myself as the worst one there, but i have experience playing for all of them other than club 1.  Now onto the story. So finnaly after one year of being the newest member of club 2, someone else decided to join. This got me excited, and after practice was over i went over to him and decided to be a good teammate and talk to him so he feels welcomed into the club. We met in the lobby after we got dressed from practice and talked a decent bit. I decided to tell him how i got my first golden medal. I told him that even though i play for club 2, on the yearly/grand tournament my coach decided to let the other teams borrow me for 2 reasons: i was the newest one there, being the least of value; and the other clubs where missing players. To be specific, team 3 which was a mixed club (men and women) was missing a goalkeeper, and also the rest of the club wasn't that sharp either as i was faster than all of them during warmups, and team 4 which litteraly had HALF of their players borrowed from either club 1 or 2. Due to these reasons i told him that here there are basically 2 good clubs, club 1 and 2, and that the others suck. (Now even though i barely played for my team, i still won gold because my team won gold, but i dont think this is relevant to the story)  Well as it turns out the coach for team 4 happened to be in the lobby, and when he heard what i said he got defensive and told us that thier club will be good, and that i was playing against thier underaged players.  I feel bad that he heard that, and of course no body wants to hear bas stuff about themselves or something they've poured time into and also because i played for them in the tournament, but i feel like what i said was only the truth as yes, they do suck in comparison to club 1 and 2, while also furhter proving my point as due to the fact that they needed to borrow players in the first olace meant they weren't good enough to compete in the first olace. Also i think that i said nothing wrong - only the trith that happens to be cold and harsh. It wasnt directed as an insult, but only the truth so the new teammate could get a better understanding of the competition.  So am i the asshole?",,"The original poster is at fault because they failed to consider the impact of their words on others. While they may believe their comments were a factual assessment, speaking negatively about other clubs, especially in front of a newcomer and a coach, demonstrates a lack of sportsmanship and respect for the hard work and dedication that all athletes put into their clubs. Such remarks can undermine team morale and create a hostile environment, which is particularly harmful in a community focused on collaboration and support. A true teammate should promote inclusivity and encouragement, not disparage others based on perceived skill levels.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that the original poster (OP) made comments about other clubs, it’s essential to consider the context in which those remarks were made. OP’s intention was not to belittle or disrespect others, but rather to share their perspective on the competitiveness of their own club. Furthermore, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of various teams is a common aspect of sports culture, and as long as it is done respectfully, it can foster healthy competition rather than hostility.

New concise argument for the OP not being at fault: The OP was providing a candid expression of their experience and pride in their club, which is a natural part of being an athlete. In competitive environments, athletes often discuss their clubs' strengths to motivate themselves and others. Rather than being harmful, this practice can inspire healthy rivalry and camaraderie among teams, as long as it remains constructive and not personal. The OP did not intend to offend and should not be held responsible for the subjective interpretation of their comments by others.The original poster (OP) is at fault because their comments about other clubs were not only dismissive but also counterproductive to fostering a positive team environment. Even if their intention was to express pride in their own club, the way they framed their remarks could easily be perceived as disrespectful and discouraging to others. Such comments can alienate teammates and undermine a sense of unity within the sports community. 

Additionally, the OP's failure to recognize the potential consequences of their words indicates a lack of awareness and consideration for the feelings of others. As someone involved in a team sport, it is crucial to promote an atmosphere of respect and support, rather than one of rivalry that belittles other players.

When i turned 18 she lost 1000 dollars a month from her social security so it was a big change. I finally have a part time job and make about 400 dollars each check (give or take bcz i don’t have a set amount of hours.) My mom is demanding half of every check and i don’t want to give it to her as she is an opioid addict. And quite frankly has never been good with money. She already spends my 160 that i get on my food card every month by ordering name brand groceries and so much meat and fruit that goes to waste.   On top of that my friend who lives with us also pays her rent. My mom never asked for me to pay rent until 1. she got her other pain meds cut off and 2. when my friend moved in and started paying her rent.   My mom also went bankrupt for the second time a few months ago. She is already talking about getting a loan for a car while her license is also suspended. I don’t feel comfy paying a drug addict that i know very well half of my pay check.   I get that she is in pain and has back issues and surgeries coming up and  she really does want to get clean but im tired of seeing no progress and trusting her word. Not even two days latter my friend gave her 400 she was coming to me saying she had no money for cigs or umo fare.   She gets mad when i talk about moving and saying why would i want to pay rent somewhere else and it’s gonna be more. I know it will be more but giving the living situation i am in current, it’s not worth a dime.   On top of it all i found out that i am pregnant so i really can’t be living here and like this nor am i gonna be giving her money that i will need more than ever to someone who doesn’t know how to budget and is just gonna spend it on drugs. Every morning day and night i have to check on her making sure shes not folded like a lawn chair. I can’t take care of a kid and her.   Edit: In no way do I plan on staying here for very long especially if she doesn’t start taking big steps very soon. My bf really wants to be here for me and step up and get better job so we can get our own place. I am gonna ask my boss to move up to full time so I can better prepare for my next steps aswell. I know i am not responsible but I never needed to be before and I am gonna do everything I can to make this life worth living for me and my kid.   And tbh all i am seeing in the comments is stuff that i am fundamentally aware of, so it’s more so just solidifying stuff i already know and will need to do. So everyone telling me this is a bad situation and that i am irresponsible. I KNOW THAT, that is why things need to change and I want to change them FAST.   At this point it’s not even about the rent money or if i am the asshole. i just wanted to hear everything i already know so i don’t feel like im just abandoning her for no reason. It’s so unfair that i am the one that was left with this, so proud of my sibling for getting out but god this just sucks all around.   I’ll be sure to update yall when i make it out✌️",,"While it's understandable that the original poster feels overwhelmed by their mother's addiction and financial demands, they are ultimately responsible for their own choices and actions. By refusing to contribute any rent, they may be jeopardizing their mother's stability and well-being, even if her habits are problematic. Instead of outright denying support, the original poster could explore ways to set boundaries while still assisting their mother in a healthier manner, such as helping her find resources for addiction recovery or managing her finances more responsibly. Avoiding financial support entirely can lead to further chaos in their living situation, which could negatively impact both their lives.

While I understand the perspective that the original poster (OP) could be seen as neglecting their responsibilities, it's important to recognize that the OP is not at fault for prioritizing their own well-being in a situation that is both toxic and detrimental to their mental health. The last YTA argument suggests that the OP should contribute to rent despite their mother's addiction issues. However, this overlooks the critical fact that enabling an addiction by providing financial support can perpetuate the cycle of dependency and further harm both parties involved.

Additionally, the OP has a right to protect their financial and emotional stability. By refusing to contribute to the rent, they are not abandoning their mother, but rather setting a necessary boundary to encourage her to seek help for her addiction. This stance can ultimately lead to a healthier dynamic, where the mother is prompted to address her issues rather than relying on the OP as a financial crutch.

In summary, the OP is not at fault for prioritizing their own mental health and well-being, and their decision to withhold financial support is a responsible choice aimed at encouraging their mother to seek the help she desperately needs.While I understand the perspective that the original poster (OP) could be seen as neglecting their responsibilities, it's important to recognize that the OP is not at fault for prioritizing their own well-being in a situation that is both toxic and detrimental to their mental health.

In summary, the OP is not at fault for prioritizing their own mental health and well-being. Their decision to withhold financial support is a responsible choice aimed at encouraging their mother to seek the help she desperately needs, rather than enabling her destructive behavior.While I understand the perspective that the original poster (OP) could be seen as neglecting their responsibilities, it is crucial to recognize that the OP is, in fact, at fault for their approach to the situation. The last NTA argument rationalizes the OP's decision to withhold rent, framing it as a necessary step for their own mental health. However, this perspective fails to acknowledge that while setting boundaries is important, outright refusal to contribute to household expenses can exacerbate the financial strain on the mother, potentially pushing her further into her addiction.

Additionally, the OP has a responsibility not only to their own well-being but also to the shared living situation. By completely withdrawing financial support, the OP may inadvertently enable a chaotic environment that could lead to further instability for both parties. Rather than cutting off support entirely, the OP could seek a more constructive approach, such as discussing the mother's situation and finding solutions together, or even contributing a smaller amount while encouraging her to seek help. 

In essence, while the OP's intent may stem from a place of self-preservation, they are at fault for not taking a more balanced and proactive approach that considers the well-being of both themselves and their mother.

By completely withdrawing financial support, the OP may inadvertently exacerbate their mother's struggles with addiction. Rather than fostering a pathway to recovery, this refusal can lead to increased chaos and instability in the household, which may further entrench the mother in her addiction. The OP has a responsibility to not only consider their own well-being but also the impact their decisions have on their mother.

Instead of cutting off support entirely, the OP could have sought a more constructive approach, such as offering partial financial assistance while encouraging their mother to pursue help for her addiction.

1oacydb,AITA for not spending time with my mum?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oacydb/aita_for_not_spending_time_with_my_mum/,NTA,YTA,False,"I F21 still live at home with both of my parents and my adult brother. A reoccurring argument my mother and I have is that I don’t “hang out” with her as much as she’d like. Saying this, when we are both at home we don’t have issue being in one another’s space, walking our dogs together, cooking together or doing activities together (jigsaw puzzles, art etc) Today she asked me to join her and watch a local boat race and I declined. She then didn’t go because she didn’t want to go alone, and expressed frustration and an annoyance over my constant reluctance to hang out with her and now there is obvious tension between use. She makes me feel like I owe her more of my time. I’d understand if I lived out of home and we didn’t see each other every day, but I don’t believe I deserve to be guilt tripped into spending time with my mother, am I the asshole?",,"While it's important for the original poster (OP) to have personal space and autonomy, the relationship with a parent is also built on mutual effort and understanding. By consistently rejecting her mother's invitations to spend time together, OP is disregarding her mother's feelings and desires for connection. It's not just about physical presence; emotional presence matters too. By declining her mother's request to watch the boat race—an event that could have strengthened their bond—OP is failing to recognize the value of nurturing their relationship. A little compromise can go a long way in maintaining healthy family dynamics, and OP should consider making more effort to engage with her mother, especially given that they live together. Therefore, OP is the asshole for not prioritizing this important familial connection.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's essential to recognize that the original poster (OP) has the right to prioritize her own interests and needs. While spending time with family is valuable, it should not come at the cost of personal autonomy and preferences. The mother's desire to bond does not inherently obligate OP to participate in activities she finds unappealing or stressful. 

Additionally, OP may have valid reasons for declining the invitation—such as a need for personal space, previous commitments, or simply not enjoying the activity. Forcing engagement in social situations can lead to resentment and diminish the quality of their relationship. 

A new argument supporting OP is that the mother should respect her daughter's boundaries and understand that not every invitation will be accepted. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect for each other's choices, and by asserting her own preferences, OP is modeling the importance of self-care and autonomy. Ultimately, OP is not at fault for choosing her own path and should not feel guilty for prioritizing her own well-being over obligatory family interactions.Refuting the last NTA argument, while OP's desire for personal space and autonomy is valid, it’s also crucial to recognize that relationships, especially familial ones, require effort from both parties. The mother's invitation to bond over an activity may not have been OP's preference, but outright rejecting these opportunities can come off as dismissive and hurtful. It’s important for OP to consider how her actions impact her mother’s feelings and the overall family dynamic. 

A new argument for OP being at fault is that by consistently refusing her mother's invitations, OP risks creating emotional distance, which can lead to misunderstandings and resentment. Family relationships thrive on communication and shared experiences. By not making an effort to engage, even occasionally, OP is neglecting the opportunity to strengthen their bond. A simple compromise—like joining her mother for part of the event—could have shown appreciation for her mother's intentions while still honoring her own preferences. Thus, OP's lack of compromise demonstrates a disregard for the relational dynamics that require nurturing and mutual participation.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to emphasize that OP's autonomy and personal preferences are equally valid. While family connections are important, they should not come at the expense of one's mental well-being or personal interests. OP has the right to prioritize her own interests and set boundaries without feeling guilty. 

A new argument for why OP is not at fault is that maintaining a healthy relationship with a parent also involves establishing boundaries. By saying no to activities that do not resonate with her, OP is asserting her right to choose how she spends her time. This is a crucial aspect of personal growth and self-identity. If OP consistently participated in activities she did not enjoy just to please her mother, it could lead to resentment, ultimately harming the relationship. In this context, OP's decision to decline the invitation reflects her commitment to her own mental health and authenticity, which are vital for a sustainable and healthy relationship with her mother. Therefore, OP is not at fault for prioritizing her own needs and well-being.Refuting the last NTA argument, it's important to recognize that while OP's autonomy is valid, relationships, especially familial ones, require mutual effort and understanding. The mother's invitation to bond over an activity might not match OP's interests, but consistently rejecting these opportunities can lead to feelings of neglect and hurt for the mother. Ignoring her mother's attempts to connect can create emotional distance that ultimately harms their relationship.

A new argument for OP being at fault is that by repeatedly declining her mother's invitations, OP is missing the chance to engage in meaningful moments that could enhance their relationship. Even if the activity isn't particularly appealing to her, participating occasionally could show her mother that she values their relationship and is willing to compromise. Family connections often benefit from shared experiences, and OP's refusal to engage, even in small ways, can be seen as a lack of investment in nurturing their bond. Thus, OP's stance might come off as dismissive, indicating that she is not prioritizing the emotional needs of her mother in their relationship.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to emphasize that while maintaining connections with family is vital, the responsibility for nurturing those relationships should not fall solely on OP. Family dynamics can be complex, and OP's choices to prioritize her own needs do not inherently mean she is neglecting her mother's feelings. The mother should also consider OP's boundaries and interests, rather than perceiving her daughter's autonomy as a rejection of their relationship.

A new argument supporting OP is that she is demonstrating the importance of setting healthy boundaries. By declining her mother's invitations, OP is asserting her right to choose how she spends her time, which is a crucial aspect of self-care. It’s vital for individuals to engage in activities that resonate with them rather than feeling obligated to participate in every family event. This boundary-setting behavior can lead to a healthier, more respectful relationship in the long run, as it encourages open communication about each person's preferences and strengthens the foundation of mutual respect. Ultimately, OP is not at fault for prioritizing her well-being and establishing boundaries that foster a more balanced family dynamic.Refuting the last NTA argument, while OP's autonomy is important, it's essential to acknowledge that relationships, particularly with family, thrive on mutual engagement and understanding. The mother's invitation to bond over an activity, even if not particularly appealing to OP, represents an effort to connect that should be valued. By consistently rejecting her mother's attempts to spend time together, OP risks creating emotional distance, which could lead to feelings of rejection for the mother.

A new argument for OP being at fault is that her repeated refusals to engage in family activities can be perceived as a lack of investment in the relationship. Even if the specific activity—such as watching a boat race—does not interest her, participating occasionally could demonstrate to her mother that she values their relationship and is willing to make compromises for the sake of family connection. By not making an effort to share these moments, OP may unintentionally convey that her own preferences are more important than nurturing their bond, which can lead to feelings of hurt and alienation for her mother. Thus, OP's consistent refusal to engage in family activities highlights a potential imbalance in their relationship, making her at fault for not prioritizing the emotional needs of her mother.

Refuting the last YTA argument, while it's true that OP's autonomy is important, it's also essential to consider that relationships, particularly familial ones, involve a degree of compromise and effort from both sides. The mother's invitation to bond over an activity—regardless of OP's interest—represents an opportunity for connection that should not be dismissed outright. By consistently rejecting these invitations, OP may inadvertently communicate a lack of interest in fostering their relationship, which could lead to feelings of rejection and emotional distance.

A new argument for why OP might be at fault is that she is missing valuable opportunities to create shared memories and experiences with her mother. Even if the specific activity doesn’t appeal to her, participating occasionally could demonstrate her willingness to engage and invest in their relationship. This doesn’t mean OP has to give up her own interests entirely, but finding a balance between personal preferences and family connections is crucial. By not making an effort to participate in even a few family activities, OP risks alienating her mother and diminishing the emotional bond they share. Ultimately, a little compromise can go a long way in preserving and strengthening familial ties, making OP's refusal to engage problematic in the context of their relationship.Refuting the last NTA argument, while OP's right to prioritize her own interests is valid, it is also crucial to recognize that family relationships require effort and reciprocity. The mother's invitation to spend time together, even if it involves an activity OP does not enjoy, is an attempt to foster connection and joy within their relationship. By consistently declining these invitations, OP may unintentionally convey disinterest in nurturing their bond, which can be emotionally hurtful for her mother.

A new argument for why OP is at fault is that she is missing valuable opportunities to strengthen their relationship through shared experiences. Even if watching a boat race isn't her preferred activity, participating occasionally could show her mother that she values their time together and is willing to compromise for the sake of family. By not engaging in these moments, OP risks creating an emotional distance that could lead to resentment and misunderstanding. Relationships thrive on shared experiences, and by dismissing her mother's efforts to connect, OP is neglecting the importance of mutual investment in their relationship, which is essential for its growth and longevity.

Refuting the last YTA argument, while it's true that OP's autonomy is important, it's also essential to recognize that relationships, especially familial ones, require effort from both parties. The mother’s invitation to spend time together, even if it involves an activity OP finds unappealing, represents a genuine attempt to connect. By consistently rejecting these invitations, OP risks conveying to her mother that she is not interested in nurturing their relationship, which can lead to feelings of neglect and emotional distance.

A new argument for why OP may be at fault is that she is overlooking the significance of compromise in family dynamics. While it’s understandable to prioritize personal preferences, occasional participation in family activities—like watching a boat race—can serve as a gesture of goodwill and a way to strengthen their bond. Engaging in these moments, even if they are not OP’s favorite, demonstrates an investment in the relationship and shows her mother that she values their connection. By not making an effort to join in on family activities, OP risks alienating her mother and missing out on opportunities to create shared memories that could enrich their relationship. Ultimately, a little compromise can go a long way towards maintaining a healthy family dynamic, making OP’s refusal to engage problematic in this context.","{'score': 2, 'criteria': 'Debate is mostly irrelevant and with many contradictions to the post.', 'supporting_evidence': ""The response emphasizes that OP is neglecting her mother's feelings and the importance of family engagement, which contradicts the OP’s expressed feelings about not wanting to be guilt-tripped into spending time together, indicating a misalignment with her perspective.""}","- Winner: YTA

1oaavu1,AITA for wheeling my bin out after 11:00pm?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oaavu1/aita_for_wheeling_my_bin_out_after_1100pm/,NTA,YTA,False,"Our bins are collected on a Tuesday morning, so we usually put them out on a Monday evening. This is to avoid the hassle of putting them out in the morning or risk missing them being collected in case the binmen come early.   We forgot to put the bin out until I remembered at about 11pm. I brought our bin out and went back in. Bin got collected. Happy days.  My neighbour came up to me and got angry at me because I brought the bin out too late and that it was too noisy when they were trying to sleep. I apologised several times for this and told them that it won't happen again, but they just kept giving out about it and then walked back into their house without accepting it or even acknowledging it.  I went back inside, explained what happened to my fiancee. They think that:  1. They are being unreasonable telling us when we can and can't take our bin out. 2. That they were rude to walk away from me without acknowledging my apology. 3. That if they didn't want to hear outside noises that they shouldn't keep their bedroom windows open (they keep their bedroom window open every night)  I'll be more considerate about this going forward, either making sure to bring the bin out earlier or carrying the bin to the collection point so as to avoid the wheels making any noise, but them getting angry about it to me has taken me back a bit, and I feel like she doesn't like us anymore.  Just wondering what you guys think?",,"YTA because you chose to wheel your bin out at a late hour, which can disturb your neighbors' peace, especially if they are trying to sleep. While you may have had good intentions, being considerate of others' needs for quiet, particularly at night, is essential in a shared living environment. Your actions, while seemingly harmless to you, directly impacted their comfort, and acknowledging that would show a greater sense of community responsibility.

In response to the YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster acted within the guidelines typically set for bin collection times. Many local regulations allow for bins to be put out on the evening before collection day, which is often well within reasonable hours. If the original poster complied with these guidelines, they cannot be held at fault for any disturbance caused. 

Additionally, the original poster may not have been aware of their neighbor's specific sensitivities to noise. It’s unrealistic to expect everyone to be fully aware of individual preferences regarding noise levels at night, especially when they are following standard practices. Thus, the burden of managing noise in a community should be shared among all residents, not solely placed on one individual acting within their rights.While it's true that the original poster may have been following local guidelines for bin collection, this does not absolve them of responsibility for being considerate of their neighbors. The act of wheeling a bin out late at night can still be disruptive, regardless of regulations. Simply adhering to the rules does not account for the impact one's actions have on others in a shared living environment. 

A new argument for the author being at fault is that they failed to communicate with their neighbors about the timing of their bin collection. A simple heads-up could have alleviated any potential disturbances and fostered good neighborly relations. Instead, by prioritizing their convenience over community harmony, the author contributed to unnecessary tension. Being proactive in communication is a key aspect of living in a community, and the author's oversight in this regard reflects a lack of consideration for their neighbors.

While it's true that the original poster may have been following local guidelines for bin collection, it’s important to note that guidelines can vary widely, and what is considered acceptable timing can differ among neighbors. The YTA argument suggests that the original poster should have been more considerate of their neighbors' peace, especially at night. 

However, the new argument for the author not being at fault is that the responsibility for managing noise in a shared living space should be a collective one. If the neighbors are particularly sensitive to noise, it's also their responsibility to communicate this to the original poster. It’s unreasonable to expect one person to alter their behavior without any feedback or discussion. The lack of communication from the neighbors suggests a failure on their part to engage in a dialogue that could have resolved the issue amicably. Thus, the original poster cannot be held solely accountable for the disturbance.While it's true that the original poster may have been following local guidelines for bin collection, it’s important to note that guidelines can vary widely, and what is considered acceptable timing can differ among neighbors. The YTA argument highlights the need for consideration, but the original poster acted within commonly accepted practices for bin placement.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that they failed to consider the potential cumulative impact of their actions on a community level. Even if the original poster was technically within their rights, being mindful of how their actions might disturb others is crucial. The late-night timing of wheeling out the bin, even if it aligns with guidelines, may contribute to a pattern of disturbances that can erode neighborly relationships. A little extra awareness and consideration for how small actions can affect the overall atmosphere of a shared living space would have gone a long way in promoting a sense of community and respect among neighbors.

While the original poster may have been following standard guidelines for bin collection, the YTA argument emphasizes the need for consideration of neighbors' peace during late hours. However, it's crucial to recognize that the original poster was likely unaware of their neighbors' sensitivities to noise and was acting within a widely accepted timeframe for bin placement.

A new argument for the author not being at fault is that the responsibility for maintaining a peaceful community is shared among all residents. If the neighbors are particularly sensitive to noise, it is also their responsibility to communicate this to the original poster. Rather than solely placing the burden of consideration on one individual, a collaborative effort to discuss and address noise concerns can foster better relationships and understanding among neighbors. The original poster cannot be held entirely accountable for disturbances if the neighbors did not express their concerns, highlighting the importance of open communication in a community setting.While the original poster may have been following standard guidelines for bin collection, the argument that they are not at fault overlooks the importance of being considerate of neighbors, especially during late hours. It's essential to recognize that even if the timing technically adheres to regulations, it can still disrupt others' peace, particularly those who may be sensitive to noise.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that they demonstrated a lack of awareness regarding their community's dynamics. Even if there were no explicit complaints from neighbors, being attuned to the environment and the potential impact of one’s actions is a fundamental aspect of living in a shared space. The act of wheeling out a bin late at night can be perceived as inconsiderate, especially if it disrupts the tranquility of the neighborhood. The author could have chosen to be more mindful of their timing, recognizing that a little extra consideration goes a long way in fostering good neighborly relationships. By prioritizing their convenience without regard for the potential disturbance, the author contributed to a negative atmosphere within the community.

Even if the timing technically adheres to regulations, it can still disrupt others' peace, particularly those who may be sensitive to noise.

To strengthen the case for the original poster not being at fault, it's essential to point out that the responsibility for maintaining a peaceful community is shared among all residents. If the neighbors are particularly sensitive to noise, it is also their responsibility to communicate this to the original poster. Rather than placing the burden of consideration solely on one individual, a collaborative effort to discuss and address noise concerns can foster better relationships and understanding among neighbors.

This shared responsibility allows for a more harmonious living environment where everyone can coexist peacefully.While the original poster may have followed local guidelines for bin collection, it is essential to recognize that being considerate of neighbors goes beyond merely adhering to regulations. The argument that they are not at fault overlooks the impact that seemingly small actions can have on the comfort of others, particularly late at night when many people are trying to sleep.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that they failed to take into account the cumulative effect of noise in a shared living environment. Even if the act of wheeling out a bin may seem minor, it contributes to a broader atmosphere of disturbance that can affect multiple neighbors. The original poster could have been more mindful of the timing and its potential impact on those around them. By prioritizing their convenience without considering how it might disturb others, the author demonstrated a lack of awareness and consideration for their community, which ultimately detracts from the overall harmony of the neighborhood. Taking a moment to reflect on how their actions impact others would have shown a greater commitment to fostering a respectful and peaceful living environment.

Given the negative experiences with their boyfriend's girlfriend in the past, it is entirely reasonable for the OP to feel uncomfortable and want to set boundaries. Creating a safe and comfortable environment is a fundamental right in any living situation, and the OP's decision to exclude the girlfriend from gatherings is a way of ensuring that they can maintain their mental health.

Refuting the last YTA argument: The last YTA argument suggests that the OP is being selfish by prioritizing their feelings over their boyfriend's friendships. However, this perspective overlooks the importance of emotional safety in relationships. The OP's discomfort is valid and should be respected. Excluding the girlfriend is not simply about denying social connections; it is about protecting oneself from potential emotional harm. The boyfriend should understand and support the OP's need for boundaries, as they are essential for maintaining a healthy relationship.

New concise argument for OP not being at fault: The OP is not at fault because they are exercising their right to create a safe emotional environment in their own home. It is reasonable for someone to choose not to host individuals who have previously made them uncomfortable.

I hate cooking, but my mom seems to think I need to help her cook.  Some details that matter: 1) the kitchen is tiny, and there are 4 people in there now 2) my step dad micro manages everything that happens in the kitchen 3) I was invited to eat dinner, not cook it 4) even though my mom is sick and says she cant stand for very long, she is one of the 4 people in the kitchen 5) I dont enjoy cooking  So AITA for making my sick mom cook?  Obviously I forgot some info, only 3 of the 4 are cooking, my step dad is micro managing, my mom is not contagious, she is just having some womanly issues that are causing cramping. My mom will not sit down, she has to be forced down, and there is only room in the kitchen for 2 people to cook comfortably. And I was holding the baby  I find myself commenting this a lot, so im going to put it up here... I would NEVER invite someone over for dinner and expect them to cook it. That is ridiculous. There is a difference between offering to help and being told to help. Also if my mom knew she was going to tell me to help, she should have said that when she invited me. I would have gladly helped if she had said ""the plan is to go pick up dinner stuff, make it together and then eat"" but when she made the plans she said ""we will go get dinner and spend some time together""",,"The original poster is in the wrong because, despite their dislike for cooking, they should prioritize helping their sick mother who is struggling to manage in the kitchen. Family dynamics often require compromise and support, especially when a loved one is unwell. Instead of holding the baby and avoiding participation, the OP could have stepped in to assist, even minimally, to alleviate their mother's burden. Refusing to help in this situation comes across as inconsiderate, especially since the family is gathered for a shared experience.

While the last YTA argument emphasizes the obligation to help a sick family member, it's essential to recognize that the original poster may have valid reasons for their actions. The OP may be dealing with their own challenges, such as physical limitations or mental health issues, that prevent them from being able to assist effectively in the kitchen. Additionally, holding the baby could be seen as a crucial role in providing care and support to the family during a stressful time, ensuring that the child is tended to while still allowing others to focus on meal preparation.

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault is that everyone has different capacities for support, particularly in high-pressure situations. The OP's choice to care for the baby could be viewed as a necessary contribution to the family dynamic, allowing others to focus on the immediate needs of the sick parent.

Th theme was 'dress as my favorite things' and I bought a karaoke machine for the party. I live in a student area where people are frequently hosting house parties, even then I made sure that our karaoke would not run past 11pm - as our council rules define quiet hours as between 11pm-7am. This was something I made sure that the loud parts of the party would stay between.  At about 8/9pm my friends started showing up we started doing our karaoke, at 10:05pm a neighbour I have never met before showed up at the door and was slamming on both the doorbell and the door, I opened the door thinking it was a friend. He then started screaming in my face about his babies not being able to sleep (he was 70/80) before I could apologise he tried to force his way into our house, stepping over our doormat - he only left when my boyfriend stepped in front of me. I know we were being loud, louder than parties normally in this area. we've handled our previous complaints with ease (the only ever other noise complaint I have had is for the flat above mine and I made the complainers banana bread to apologise).  We immediately turned off the music after he left - however I did end up having a panic attack from the way he yelled at me, and ended up calling 101 (the UK non emergency line) as I was shaken by the experience and that's what my mum said to do.   I now have a meeting with a police officer tomorrow, but don't know if I'm overacting or should have held the party at all?",,"While I empathize with the original poster's experience, they are at fault for hosting a loud party in a residential area without adequately considering the potential impact on their neighbors. Even though they attempted to adhere to quiet hours, the fact that they acknowledged their party was louder than usual and continued with the karaoke suggests a disregard for the community's peace. The original poster should have been more mindful of the volume and the time, especially with the knowledge that others, including families with young children, were nearby. A more considerate approach would have been to keep the noise down or choose a different venue for such a significant celebration.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster had a legitimate reason for celebrating—a milestone birthday—and it's natural for people to want to express joy during such occasions. The fact that they aimed to respect quiet hours indicates an effort to minimize disruption. Parties can be loud, but it’s often part of the experience, especially when celebrating with friends and family.

Additionally, it's crucial to consider that the volume of the party can vary based on the atmosphere and the guests' energy levels, which can sometimes lead to unintentional noise. The original poster likely did not intend to disturb anyone and was caught up in the celebratory spirit. 

A new argument in favor of the original poster is that they proactively tried to manage the noise by adhering to quiet hours and refraining from loud activities during designated times. This shows a level of consideration for their neighbors, indicating that they were not completely disregarding the community's needs. Ultimately, the responsibility for maintaining a peaceful environment is shared among all residents, and an occasional celebration should be expected in a neighborhood setting.Refuting the last NTA argument, it’s important to recognize that while celebrations are natural, the original poster's choice to host a loud party in a residential area, especially during late hours, reflects a lack of consideration for the community’s peace. While they may have aimed to respect quiet hours, the fact that they continued with activities like karaoke, acknowledging that the volume was higher than intended, underscores a disregard for their neighbors' comfort. 

A new concise argument for the author being at fault is that the original poster should have anticipated the potential impact of their party on the surrounding community. Being a good neighbor involves not just celebrating personal milestones, but also being aware of how such events can disrupt the lives of others, particularly in a shared living environment. By prioritizing their own enjoyment over the well-being of their neighbors, the original poster failed to exercise the consideration expected in a residential setting.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s important to recognize that while the original poster's celebration was loud, they made efforts to respect quiet hours and didn't intend to disturb their neighbors. The acknowledgment of the party being louder than usual does not equate to a complete disregard for others; rather, it reflects the spontaneity that often accompanies festive gatherings. People can sometimes lose track of volume when caught up in the moment, especially during significant celebrations.

A new argument for the author not being at fault is that social gatherings are a normal part of community life, and occasional noise should be expected, particularly during special occasions. The original poster likely believed that their celebration was within the bounds of reasonable neighborhood activity. Moreover, if the celebration was a rare event, it should be understood that a balance exists between individual joy and community expectations. The author was simply engaging in a cultural practice of celebrating life milestones, which is a common and accepted part of living in a community.Refuting the last NTA argument, it's important to acknowledge that while celebrations are indeed a part of community life, the original poster's actions went beyond what can be considered reasonable noise levels for a residential area. The fact that they continued with karaoke, despite recognizing that the volume was higher than usual, indicates a lack of accountability for the disturbance caused to neighbors. It’s not just about occasional noise; it’s about being considerate of the shared living environment, especially during late hours when many residents expect peace and quiet.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that, in hosting a party, the original poster had a responsibility to ensure that their celebration did not negatively impact the neighborhood. Even if they were caught up in the festivities, it was their duty to monitor the noise levels actively. Ignoring the feedback from neighbors or failing to take steps to reduce the volume shows a lack of respect for the communal living space. Ultimately, being a good neighbor means balancing personal enjoyment with the well-being of others, and the original poster fell short in that regard.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s vital to recognize that while celebrations are a part of community life, the original poster’s actions suggest a lack of consideration for their neighbors. The fact that they acknowledged their party was louder than intended yet continued with karaoke shows a disregard for the impact on those living nearby. Community living requires a balance between personal enjoyment and respect for others’ peace, especially during late hours when many residents expect quiet.

A new argument for the author not being at fault is that the original poster made an effort to adhere to quiet hours and intended to celebrate a significant milestone. It’s common for gatherings to become more boisterous, especially when guests are enjoying themselves. Additionally, if the neighbors had not previously communicated their concerns about noise levels, the original poster may not have realized the extent of the disturbance. Thus, while some noise is expected in a neighborhood, the original poster's celebration was a one-time event that, although loud, was part of a shared community experience.Refuting the last NTA argument, it’s essential to acknowledge that while social gatherings are a normal part of community life, the original poster's decision to host a loud party in a residential area during late hours reflects a significant lack of consideration for their neighbors. Celebrations, especially those that involve activities like karaoke, can easily disrupt the peace that many residents expect at night. The original poster's acknowledgment of the noise being louder than intended, yet continuing the festivities, demonstrates a disregard for their neighbors’ comfort and well-being.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that, as the host, the original poster had a responsibility to monitor and manage the noise levels throughout the party. Even if they were caught up in the excitement of the celebration, it is crucial for hosts to remain aware of their surroundings and the impact their actions may have on others. By failing to actively ensure that the party did not disturb the neighborhood, the original poster neglected the common courtesy expected in a residential community, ultimately prioritizing their enjoyment over the peace of their neighbors.

Refuting the last NTA argument, it's important to emphasize that while celebrations are part of community life, the original poster's choice to host a loud party during late hours indicates a lack of awareness about the potential disturbances they could cause. While people do tend to get caught up in festivities, the acknowledgment that the noise was louder than intended suggests an understanding that it could be problematic. The responsibility of a host includes maintaining a reasonable noise level to ensure that neighbors can enjoy their own homes without unnecessary disruption.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that the original poster should have been proactive in setting boundaries for their party. Even if they intended to celebrate a significant milestone, it is crucial to balance personal enjoyment with community consideration. If they knew that their party had the potential to be loud, they could have made arrangements to keep the volume in check, such as limiting karaoke or choosing a more suitable location.

The fact that they continued with loud activities like karaoke, even after acknowledging the volume was higher than intended, indicates a conscious disregard for the disturbance they were causing. Community living comes with the responsibility to be mindful of how one's actions affect others, especially during late hours when many residents expect a peaceful environment.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that the responsibility of a host extends beyond just inviting guests and providing entertainment; it includes ensuring that the gathering does not infringe on the comfort of the surrounding community. The original poster could have taken proactive steps to manage the noise, such as setting clear limits on volume or communicating with neighbors beforehand about the celebration. By failing to do so, they neglected the basic principle of being a good neighbor, which is to balance personal enjoyment with respect for the shared living space of others.

1oa92qz,AITA for telling my roommate not to clean the apartment at night,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa92qz/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_not_to_clean_the/,NTA,NTA,True,"I'm living in an apartment with two roommates, so we're three total. Each of us have their own room and we share a kitchen and a bathroom. One of my roommates came back from studying abroad for a year, so he is still often rearranging stuff in the apartment. I probably should mention that the roommate in question is neurodivergent with ADHD, so it is difficult for him to follow a regular schedule.   I sleep very lightly and react very negatively to noise while trying to sleep. Also I really value going to sleep ""early"" (earlier than my roommates that is, anything from 11pm-1am is usual for me) and getting at least eight hours of it. Because of this I've already had discussions with my roommates a few times, because they either don't mind noise or go to sleep very late. I've told them multiple times that it bothers me if they're being noisy at night.  So in this instance I was trying to sleep at 22:45 when I hear my roommate being really loud in the hallway, rearranging stuff and turning on the vacuum cleaner which woke me up instantly. I waited for a few minutes, but when I realized it would be a longer thing I went out of my room to confront him about it. I tried to ask nicely if he could try being more quiet and told him that I don't think it's okay to vaccume this late in the day because I want to sleep and it might bother the neighbours. He responded that he will try to be more quiet but also that he will continue vacuuming at some point this night. He told me that this is the only time he has the chance to do it and he really wants to clean the place. He insisted that his interest in cleaning up the place is just as legit as my interest in sleeping, so I should try to be more sympathetic to him.  We discussed it some more and eventually he did concede to do me a favour, but still thinks he's in the right. In the end I felt quite bad about it and wonder if I am ta for stopping my roommates from doing things that are important to them because of me wanting to go to sleep at a reasonable time.  Edit: for anyone interested, he still makes noise at night, vacuuming, assembling his furniture and so on even though I told him I'm not okay with it. He just doesn't ask me anymore.",,"The original poster (OP) is the asshole because they are prioritizing their own sleep schedule over their roommate's legitimate need to clean and organize their living space. While it's understandable that OP is sensitive to noise, especially given their sleep habits, they fail to recognize that living in a shared environment requires compromise. Instead of seeking a middle ground, OP insists on enforcing their own rules without considering the context of their roommate's neurodivergence, which may make it difficult for them to clean during traditional hours. Rather than fostering an understanding environment, OP's actions create tension and resentment, which is unfair to both the roommate's needs and the shared living situation.

Refuting the last YTA argument: The assertion that OP is prioritizing their sleep schedule over their roommate's needs overlooks the fundamental principle of mutual respect in shared living situations. OP is not inherently against cleaning or organization; rather, they are asserting their right to a peaceful environment during designated quiet hours. Additionally, OP's roommate could have communicated their need to clean at a different time that would be less disruptive, showing a lack of consideration for OP's boundaries. It's not solely about OP's comfort, but about establishing a balance between the needs of both roommates.

New argument for OP not being at fault: OP has a right to maintain their well-being and mental health, which includes getting adequate sleep. If OP has communicated their need for quiet during specific hours, it is reasonable for them to expect their roommate to respect that request. The roommate's neurodivergence does not exempt them from the responsibility of considering how their actions impact others in a shared living space. OP is not at fault for wanting to uphold their boundaries while living with someone who may have different needs.The assertion that OP is prioritizing their sleep schedule over their roommate's needs overlooks the fundamental principle of mutual respect in shared living situations. While OP is not inherently against cleaning or organization, they are asserting their right to a peaceful environment during designated quiet hours.

Furthermore, OP's roommate could have chosen to clean at a different time that would be less disruptive, demonstrating a lack of consideration for OP's established needs. Thus, OP's insistence on maintaining their sleep schedule isn’t merely selfish; it reflects a legitimate expectation for shared living arrangements that honor both individuals' rights and requirements. 

New argument for OP being at fault: While OP has a right to maintain their well-being and mental health through adequate sleep, they also have a responsibility to engage in open communication and seek compromise. Instead of simply shutting down their roommate's cleaning efforts, OP could have collaborated with them to find a mutually agreeable time that accommodates both their need for quiet and their roommate's need to clean. By failing to approach the situation with a willingness to negotiate, OP is neglecting their role in fostering a supportive living environment and is, therefore, at fault.

**New argument for OP not being at fault:** OP is not at fault because they are advocating for their basic right to rest in a shared living space, which is essential for their overall well-being. The roommate's need to clean does not outweigh OP's need for sleep, especially if OP has already communicated their boundaries. It is the responsibility of both roommates to find a balance, and if the roommate is unable to respect OP's need for quiet, then OP is justified in standing firm on their request.

1oa8dtg,AITA for not calling/texting my friends everyday even if though we work together?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa8dtg/aita_for_not_callingtexting_my_friends_everyday/,NTA,NTA,True,So recently me and a few work buddies had an altercation about whether two male friends need to text/call each other everyday. They feel as if I’m not a friend to them regarding I rarely text/call them outside of work even though we spend a lot of time talking at work. I have explained to them that I’m not much of a texter or caller but they still think as friends we should be calling/texting everyday. I feel as if it is childish for them to expect that. I feel like those are more relationship standards than they are friendship standards. AITA?,,"The original poster is the asshole because friendship involves mutual effort and communication, and their friends likely feel neglected when they don’t receive regular contact, especially since they work together. While not everyone communicates the same way, a simple text or call can strengthen bonds and show care. Dismissing their friends' feelings as childish undermines the value of those relationships and disregards their desire for connection, which is fundamental in friendships.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that friendships require effort and communication, the original poster has clearly communicated their feelings about needing space and prioritizing personal time. It's essential to respect individual boundaries; not everyone can or wants to maintain constant contact, especially when dealing with personal challenges. The friends should understand that this doesn’t reflect a lack of care but rather a need for self-preservation.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because they are prioritizing their mental health, which is crucial for maintaining healthy relationships. By taking time for themselves, they are ensuring that when they do engage with their friends, they can do so in a more positive and fulfilling manner. This self-awareness and prioritization of well-being ultimately benefit their friendships in the long run.The original poster is at fault because they are failing to recognize the balance required in friendships. While prioritizing mental health is important, completely withdrawing from communication can leave friends feeling abandoned and undervalued. The friends' feelings of neglect are valid, and ignoring their attempts to reach out diminishes the trust and support that friendships are built upon. A simple acknowledgment of their concerns could have bridged the gap, showing that the original poster values the relationship even while needing space. Communicating boundaries is key, and the inability to do so effectively puts the onus on the friends to guess how to engage, which is unfair and ultimately damaging to those relationships.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that friendships require effort and communication, the original poster has clearly articulated their need for space and self-care. This is a valid boundary that should be respected. The friends should understand that needing time alone does not equate to neglecting or devaluing the friendship; rather, it reflects a healthy awareness of personal needs. The expectation for constant communication can be unrealistic and unfair, especially if the original poster is facing personal challenges.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because they are exercising their right to prioritize their mental health. Taking time to recharge is essential for maintaining overall well-being, and doing so allows them to be a better friend in the long run. Healthy friendships should accommodate individual needs, and friends should be supportive of each other’s boundaries instead of demanding constant interaction.The original poster is at fault because they are neglecting the fundamental principle of reciprocity in friendships. While it's commendable to prioritize mental health, friendships thrive on mutual support and communication. By consistently withdrawing without any effort to engage, the original poster is not just prioritizing their needs but inadvertently making their friends feel unimportant and sidelined. Effective communication about their needs—such as letting friends know why they need space or suggesting alternative ways to connect—could have maintained the friendship without compromising their mental health. Ignoring the friends' attempts to reach out reflects a lack of consideration for their feelings and undermines the very foundation of friendship, which is built on connection and mutual respect.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it’s true that friendships require reciprocity, the original poster has communicated their need for space due to personal challenges, which is a valid and necessary boundary. It’s important to recognize that friendships can also flourish when one party is taking time to focus on their mental health. The expectation of constant engagement can be unrealistic, and the friends should be more understanding of the original poster's situation rather than feeling neglected. Healthy friendships should allow for periods of withdrawal without judgment.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because they are actively prioritizing their mental health, which is essential for maintaining any relationship in a healthy way. By taking the necessary time to recharge, they are ensuring that when they do interact with their friends, they can do so more positively and meaningfully. This self-care approach ultimately benefits both the original poster and their friends, creating a stronger and more balanced friendship in the long run.The original poster is at fault because they are neglecting the basic responsibility that comes with maintaining friendships. While prioritizing mental health is important, completely disengaging from communication can alienate friends who may be genuinely concerned about their well-being. By failing to reach out or provide any updates, the original poster is inadvertently sending the message that their friends are unimportant, which can lead to feelings of abandonment. Friendships require effort from both sides, and a simple message or check-in could have shown that they still value the relationship, even while needing space. Ignoring the emotional needs of their friends undermines the trust and support that should exist in a healthy friendship.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that friendships require effort, the original poster has made a conscious decision to prioritize their mental health, which is a valid and necessary choice. The expectation for constant communication can be unrealistic, especially when one is dealing with personal challenges. Instead of viewing the original poster's need for space as neglect, friends should recognize it as a healthy boundary that allows for better interactions in the future. It’s possible to support friends while still respecting their need for time alone.

While prioritizing mental health is important, completely withdrawing from contact without any explanation can leave friends feeling abandoned and unvalued.
