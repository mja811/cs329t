--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: I’m 20 years old and my mom has been an
addict for as long as i can remember. When i turned 18 she lost 1000 dollars a
month from her social security so it was a big change. I finally have a part
time job and make about 400 dollars each check (give or take bcz i don’t have a
set amount of hours.) My mom is demanding half of every check and i don’t want
to give it to her as she is an opioid addict. And quite frankly has never been
good with money. She already spends my 160 that i get on my food card every
month by ordering name brand groceries and so much meat and fruit that goes to
waste.   On top of that my friend who lives with us also pays her rent. My mom
never asked for me to pay rent until 1. she got her other pain meds cut off and
2. when my friend moved in and started paying her rent.   My mom also went
bankrupt for the second time a few months ago. She is already talking about
getting a loan for a car while her license is also suspended. I don’t feel comfy
paying a drug addict that i know very well half of my pay check.   I get that
she is in pain and has back issues and surgeries coming up and  she really does
want to get clean but im tired of seeing no progress and trusting her word. Not
even two days latter my friend gave her 400 she was coming to me saying she had
no money for cigs or umo fare.   She gets mad when i talk about moving and
saying why would i want to pay rent somewhere else and it’s gonna be more. I
know it will be more but giving the living situation i am in current, it’s not
worth a dime.   On top of it all i found out that i am pregnant so i really
can’t be living here and like this nor am i gonna be giving her money that i
will need more than ever to someone who doesn’t know how to budget and is just
gonna spend it on drugs. Every morning day and night i have to check on her
making sure shes not folded like a lawn chair. I can’t take care of a kid and
her.   Edit: In no way do I plan on staying here for very long especially if she
doesn’t start taking big steps very soon. My bf really wants to be here for me
and step up and get better job so we can get our own place. I am gonna ask my
boss to move up to full time so I can better prepare for my next steps aswell. I
know i am not responsible but I never needed to be before and I am gonna do
everything I can to make this life worth living for me and my kid.   And tbh all
i am seeing in the comments is stuff that i am fundamentally aware of, so it’s
more so just solidifying stuff i already know and will need to do. So everyone
telling me this is a bad situation and that i am irresponsible. I KNOW THAT,
that is why things need to change and I want to change them FAST.   At this
point it’s not even about the rent money or if i am the asshole. i just wanted
to hear everything i already know so i don’t feel like im just abandoning her
for no reason. It’s so unfair that i am the one that was left with this, so
proud of my sibling for getting out but god this just sucks all around.   I’ll
be sure to update yall when i make it out✌️

Opposing side:

While it's understandable that the original poster feels overwhelmed by their
mother's addiction and financial demands, they are ultimately responsible for
their own choices and actions. By refusing to contribute any rent, they may be
jeopardizing their mother's stability and well-being, even if her habits are
problematic. Instead of outright denying support, the original poster could
explore ways to set boundaries while still assisting their mother in a healthier
manner, such as helping her find resources for addiction recovery or managing
her finances more responsibly. Avoiding financial support entirely can lead to
further chaos in their living situation, which could negatively impact both
their lives.

While I understand the perspective that the original poster (OP) could be seen
as neglecting their responsibilities, it's important to recognize that the OP is
not at fault for prioritizing their own well-being in a situation that is both
toxic and detrimental to their mental health. The last YTA argument suggests
that the OP should contribute to rent despite their mother's addiction issues.
However, this overlooks the critical fact that enabling an addiction by
providing financial support can perpetuate the cycle of dependency and further
harm both parties involved.  Additionally, the OP has a right to protect their
financial and emotional stability. By refusing to contribute to the rent, they
are not abandoning their mother, but rather setting a necessary boundary to
encourage her to seek help for her addiction. This stance can ultimately lead to
a healthier dynamic, where the mother is prompted to address her issues rather
than relying on the OP as a financial crutch.  In summary, the OP is not at
fault for prioritizing their own mental health and well-being, and their
decision to withhold financial support is a responsible choice aimed at
encouraging their mother to seek the help she desperately needs.

OP should contribute to rent despite their mother's addiction issues. However,
this overlooks the critical fact that enabling an addiction by providing
financial support can perpetuate the cycle of dependency and further harm both
parties involved.  Moreover, the OP has every right to protect their financial
and emotional stability. By refusing to contribute to the rent, they are not
abandoning their mother but rather setting essential boundaries that could
encourage her to seek help for her addiction. This approach can ultimately lead
to a healthier dynamic, pushing the mother to confront her issues rather than
relying on the OP as a financial crutch.  In summary, the OP is not at fault for
prioritizing their own mental health and well-being. Their decision to withhold

behavior.

While I understand the perspective that the original poster (OP) could be seen
as neglecting their responsibilities, it is crucial to recognize that the OP is,
in fact, at fault for their approach to the situation. The last NTA argument
rationalizes the OP's decision to withhold rent, framing it as a necessary step
for their own mental health. However, this perspective fails to acknowledge that
while setting boundaries is important, outright refusal to contribute to
household expenses can exacerbate the financial strain on the mother,
potentially pushing her further into her addiction.  Additionally, the OP has a
responsibility not only to their own well-being but also to the shared living
situation. By completely withdrawing financial support, the OP may inadvertently
enable a chaotic environment that could lead to further instability for both
parties. Rather than cutting off support entirely, the OP could seek a more
constructive approach, such as discussing the mother's situation and finding
solutions together, or even contributing a smaller amount while encouraging her
to seek help.   In essence, while the OP's intent may stem from a place of self-
preservation, they are at fault for not taking a more balanced and proactive
approach that considers the well-being of both themselves and their mother.
Setting boundaries is necessary, but so is finding a way to address the
underlying issues collaboratively.

is at fault for their overall approach to the situation. The last NTA argument
suggests that the OP's refusal to contribute to rent is a healthy boundary-
setting mechanism, but this perspective overlooks the potential consequences of
their actions on their mother’s already precarious situation.  By completely
withdrawing financial support, the OP may inadvertently exacerbate their
mother's struggles with addiction. Rather than fostering a pathway to recovery,
this refusal can lead to increased chaos and instability in the household, which
may further entrench the mother in her addiction. The OP has a responsibility to
not only consider their own well-being but also the impact their decisions have
on their mother.  Instead of cutting off support entirely, the OP could have
sought a more constructive approach, such as offering partial financial
assistance while encouraging their mother to pursue help for her addiction. This
would demonstrate a commitment to both their own mental health and their
mother's recovery, creating an opportunity for dialogue and potential healing.
In conclusion, while the OP's intent may stem from a desire to protect
themselves, they are at fault for not taking a more balanced and proactive
approach that considers the well-being of both themselves and their mother.
Setting boundaries is important, but so is finding a way to address the

Moderator Summary: - Winner: NTA - Strength: 75% vs 25% - Reasoning: The NTA
argument emphasizes the importance of prioritizing one's own mental health and
well-being in a toxic environment, asserting that withholding financial support
can be a necessary boundary to encourage the mother to seek help for her
addiction. It highlights the potential harm of enabling the mother's destructive
behavior through financial support, making a morally compelling case for self-
preservation and promoting healthier dynamics. In contrast, the YTA argument
focuses on responsibility to contribute to household expenses but fails to
effectively address the potential negative consequences of enabling addiction,
weakening its moral stance.   Final winner: NTA
