--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: So recently me and a few work buddies had an
altercation about whether two male friends need to text/call each other
everyday. They feel as if I’m not a friend to them regarding I rarely text/call
them outside of work even though we spend a lot of time talking at work. I have
explained to them that I’m not much of a texter or caller but they still think
as friends we should be calling/texting everyday. I feel as if it is childish
for them to expect that. I feel like those are more relationship standards than
they are friendship standards. AITA?

Opposing side:

The original poster is the asshole because friendship involves mutual effort and
communication, and their friends likely feel neglected when they don’t receive
regular contact, especially since they work together. While not everyone
communicates the same way, a simple text or call can strengthen bonds and show
care. Dismissing their friends' feelings as childish undermines the value of
those relationships and disregards their desire for connection, which is
fundamental in friendships.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that friendships require effort
and communication, the original poster has clearly communicated their feelings
about needing space and prioritizing personal time. It's essential to respect
individual boundaries; not everyone can or wants to maintain constant contact,
especially when dealing with personal challenges. The friends should understand
that this doesn’t reflect a lack of care but rather a need for self-
preservation.  New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because
they are prioritizing their mental health, which is crucial for maintaining
healthy relationships. By taking time for themselves, they are ensuring that
when they do engage with their friends, they can do so in a more positive and
fulfilling manner. This self-awareness and prioritization of well-being
ultimately benefit their friendships in the long run.

The original poster is at fault because they are failing to recognize the
balance required in friendships. While prioritizing mental health is important,
completely withdrawing from communication can leave friends feeling abandoned
and undervalued. The friends' feelings of neglect are valid, and ignoring their
attempts to reach out diminishes the trust and support that friendships are
built upon. A simple acknowledgment of their concerns could have bridged the
gap, showing that the original poster values the relationship even while needing
space. Communicating boundaries is key, and the inability to do so effectively
puts the onus on the friends to guess how to engage, which is unfair and
ultimately damaging to those relationships.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that friendships require effort
and communication, the original poster has clearly articulated their need for
space and self-care. This is a valid boundary that should be respected. The
friends should understand that needing time alone does not equate to neglecting
or devaluing the friendship; rather, it reflects a healthy awareness of personal
needs. The expectation for constant communication can be unrealistic and unfair,
especially if the original poster is facing personal challenges.  New concise
argument: The original poster is not at fault because they are exercising their
right to prioritize their mental health. Taking time to recharge is essential
for maintaining overall well-being, and doing so allows them to be a better
friend in the long run. Healthy friendships should accommodate individual needs,
and friends should be supportive of each other’s boundaries instead of demanding
constant interaction.

The original poster is at fault because they are neglecting the fundamental
principle of reciprocity in friendships. While it's commendable to prioritize
mental health, friendships thrive on mutual support and communication. By
consistently withdrawing without any effort to engage, the original poster is
not just prioritizing their needs but inadvertently making their friends feel
unimportant and sidelined. Effective communication about their needs—such as
letting friends know why they need space or suggesting alternative ways to
connect—could have maintained the friendship without compromising their mental
health. Ignoring the friends' attempts to reach out reflects a lack of
consideration for their feelings and undermines the very foundation of
friendship, which is built on connection and mutual respect.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it’s true that friendships require
reciprocity, the original poster has communicated their need for space due to
personal challenges, which is a valid and necessary boundary. It’s important to
recognize that friendships can also flourish when one party is taking time to
focus on their mental health. The expectation of constant engagement can be
unrealistic, and the friends should be more understanding of the original
poster's situation rather than feeling neglected. Healthy friendships should
allow for periods of withdrawal without judgment.  New concise argument: The
original poster is not at fault because they are actively prioritizing their
mental health, which is essential for maintaining any relationship in a healthy
way. By taking the necessary time to recharge, they are ensuring that when they
do interact with their friends, they can do so more positively and meaningfully.
This self-care approach ultimately benefits both the original poster and their
friends, creating a stronger and more balanced friendship in the long run.

The original poster is at fault because they are neglecting the basic
responsibility that comes with maintaining friendships. While prioritizing
mental health is important, completely disengaging from communication can
alienate friends who may be genuinely concerned about their well-being. By
failing to reach out or provide any updates, the original poster is
inadvertently sending the message that their friends are unimportant, which can
lead to feelings of abandonment. Friendships require effort from both sides, and
a simple message or check-in could have shown that they still value the
relationship, even while needing space. Ignoring the emotional needs of their
friends undermines the trust and support that should exist in a healthy
friendship.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that friendships require effort,
the original poster has made a conscious decision to prioritize their mental
health, which is a valid and necessary choice. The expectation for constant
communication can be unrealistic, especially when one is dealing with personal
challenges. Instead of viewing the original poster's need for space as neglect,
friends should recognize it as a healthy boundary that allows for better
interactions in the future. It’s possible to support friends while still
respecting their need for time alone.  New concise argument: The original poster
is not at fault because they are taking essential steps to ensure their mental
well-being, which ultimately enables them to be a better friend. By setting
boundaries and focusing on self-care, they can approach their friendships with
renewed energy and positivity. Healthy relationships should accommodate
individual needs, and friends should be supportive of each other's boundaries
rather than demanding constant interaction. This approach fosters a more
understanding and resilient friendship in the long term.

The original poster is at fault because they are neglecting the emotional needs
of their friends and failing to communicate effectively. While prioritizing
mental health is important, completely withdrawing from contact without any
explanation can leave friends feeling abandoned and unvalued. Friendships rely
on mutual support, and by not acknowledging their friends' attempts to reach
out, the original poster is effectively sidelining the very relationships that
could provide support during difficult times. A simple message or acknowledgment
could go a long way in maintaining those connections, showing that they care
about their friends even while needing space. Ignoring the emotional dynamics of
friendship undermines its foundation and can lead to long-term damage in those
relationships.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it’s true that friendships require effort
and communication, the original poster is prioritizing their mental health,
which is crucial for maintaining any relationship. They have not completely
withdrawn but have chosen to take a step back during a challenging time. It’s
important to recognize that friendships can withstand periods of reduced
contact, especially when one party is dealing with personal issues. Instead of
labeling the original poster as at fault, friends should be more understanding
and supportive of this boundary, as it ultimately allows for healthier
interactions in the future.  New concise argument: The original poster is not at
fault because they are taking necessary steps to prioritize their mental health,
which is essential for their overall well-being. By focusing on self-care, they
are ensuring that when they do engage with their friends, they can do so in a
more positive and meaningful way. Healthy friendships should allow for periods
of withdrawal without guilt or judgment, as this self-awareness ultimately
benefits both the original poster and their friends in the long run.

arguments from the NTA side emphasize the importance of prioritizing mental
health and setting boundaries, highlighting that taking time for oneself can
