--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: I'm living in an apartment with two
roommates, so we're three total. Each of us have their own room and we share a
kitchen and a bathroom. One of my roommates came back from studying abroad for a
year, so he is still often rearranging stuff in the apartment. I probably should
mention that the roommate in question is neurodivergent with ADHD, so it is
difficult for him to follow a regular schedule.   I sleep very lightly and react
very negatively to noise while trying to sleep. Also I really value going to
sleep "early" (earlier than my roommates that is, anything from 11pm-1am is
usual for me) and getting at least eight hours of it. Because of this I've
already had discussions with my roommates a few times, because they either don't
mind noise or go to sleep very late. I've told them multiple times that it
bothers me if they're being noisy at night.  So in this instance I was trying to
sleep at 22:45 when I hear my roommate being really loud in the hallway,
rearranging stuff and turning on the vacuum cleaner which woke me up instantly.
I waited for a few minutes, but when I realized it would be a longer thing I
went out of my room to confront him about it. I tried to ask nicely if he could
try being more quiet and told him that I don't think it's okay to vaccume this
late in the day because I want to sleep and it might bother the neighbours. He
responded that he will try to be more quiet but also that he will continue
vacuuming at some point this night. He told me that this is the only time he has
the chance to do it and he really wants to clean the place. He insisted that his
interest in cleaning up the place is just as legit as my interest in sleeping,
so I should try to be more sympathetic to him.  We discussed it some more and
eventually he did concede to do me a favour, but still thinks he's in the right.
In the end I felt quite bad about it and wonder if I am ta for stopping my
roommates from doing things that are important to them because of me wanting to
go to sleep at a reasonable time.  Edit: for anyone interested, he still makes
noise at night, vacuuming, assembling his furniture and so on even though I told
him I'm not okay with it. He just doesn't ask me anymore.

Opposing side:

The original poster (OP) is the asshole because they are prioritizing their own
sleep schedule over their roommate's legitimate need to clean and organize their
living space. While it's understandable that OP is sensitive to noise,
especially given their sleep habits, they fail to recognize that living in a
shared environment requires compromise. Instead of seeking a middle ground, OP
insists on enforcing their own rules without considering the context of their
roommate's neurodivergence, which may make it difficult for them to clean during
traditional hours. Rather than fostering an understanding environment, OP's
actions create tension and resentment, which is unfair to both the roommate's
needs and the shared living situation.

Refuting the last YTA argument: The assertion that OP is prioritizing their
sleep schedule over their roommate's needs overlooks the fundamental principle
of mutual respect in shared living situations. OP is not inherently against
cleaning or organization; rather, they are asserting their right to a peaceful
environment during designated quiet hours. Additionally, OP's roommate could
have communicated their need to clean at a different time that would be less
disruptive, showing a lack of consideration for OP's boundaries. It's not solely
about OP's comfort, but about establishing a balance between the needs of both
roommates.  New argument for OP not being at fault: OP has a right to maintain
their well-being and mental health, which includes getting adequate sleep. If OP
has communicated their need for quiet during specific hours, it is reasonable
for them to expect their roommate to respect that request. The roommate's
neurodivergence does not exempt them from the responsibility of considering how
their actions impact others in a shared living space. OP is not at fault for
wanting to uphold their boundaries while living with someone who may have
different needs.

The assertion that OP is prioritizing their sleep schedule over their roommate's
needs overlooks the fundamental principle of mutual respect in shared living
situations. While OP is not inherently against cleaning or organization, they
are asserting their right to a peaceful environment during designated quiet
hours. It is reasonable for OP to expect their roommate to respect these
boundaries, especially since OP has communicated their need for quiet during
specific times.   Furthermore, OP's roommate could have chosen to clean at a
different time that would be less disruptive, demonstrating a lack of
consideration for OP's established needs. Thus, OP's insistence on maintaining
their sleep schedule isn’t merely selfish; it reflects a legitimate expectation
for shared living arrangements that honor both individuals' rights and
requirements.   New argument for OP being at fault: While OP has a right to
maintain their well-being and mental health through adequate sleep, they also
have a responsibility to engage in open communication and seek compromise.
Instead of simply shutting down their roommate's cleaning efforts, OP could have
collaborated with them to find a mutually agreeable time that accommodates both
their need for quiet and their roommate's need to clean. By failing to approach
the situation with a willingness to negotiate, OP is neglecting their role in
fostering a supportive living environment and is, therefore, at fault.

**New argument for OP not being at fault:** OP is not at fault because they are
advocating for their basic right to rest in a shared living space, which is
essential for their overall well-being. The roommate's need to clean does not
outweigh OP's need for sleep, especially if OP has already communicated their
boundaries. It is the responsibility of both roommates to find a balance, and if
the roommate is unable to respect OP's need for quiet, then OP is justified in
standing firm on their request. The situation calls for mutual respect, and OP
is simply upholding their right to a peaceful living environment.

create a more supportive and understanding atmosphere, thus contributing to the

Moderator Summary: - Winner: NTA - Strength: 70% vs 30% - Reasoning: The
arguments supporting OP as not the asshole (NTA) emphasize the importance of
mutual respect, the right to a peaceful environment, and the responsibility of
both roommates to communicate and compromise. OP's right to sleep and mental
health is a legitimate concern in a shared living space, and the roommate's
actions were deemed inconsiderate of OP's needs. In contrast, the arguments
labeling OP as the asshole (YTA) focus on the need for empathy and flexibility
without sufficiently addressing OP's established boundaries and the roommate's
lack of communication. Overall, the NTA side presented a stronger moral argument
based on rights and established communication.   Final winner: NTA

- **Prioritize Your Needs**: It's important to assert your right to a peaceful
environment, especially regarding your sleep and mental health. Make sure to
communicate clearly about your boundaries.  - **Engage in Open Communication**:
Discuss your needs and feelings with your roommate. Encourage them to express
their own needs too, fostering a mutual understanding.  - **Encourage
Compromise**: Find ways to accommodate each other's schedules or preferences so
both of you feel respected and comfortable in the shared space.  - **Set Clear
Boundaries**: Define what is acceptable and unacceptable regarding noise levels
and other disruptive behaviors, ensuring both parties are aware and agree to
these guidelines.  - **Document Agreements**: If necessary, follow up your
conversation with a written agreement outlining the compromises both of you have
committed to, helping to avoid future misunderstandings.  - **Evaluate the
Living Situation**: If issues persist and your needs continue to be overlooked,
consider whether this living arrangement is still suitable for you. Prioritize
your well-being.  - **Seek Support if Necessary**: If discussions do not lead to
improvement, consider involving a neutral third party, like a landlord or
mediator, who can help facilitate the conversation.
