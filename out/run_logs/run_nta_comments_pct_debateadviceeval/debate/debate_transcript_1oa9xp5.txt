--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: My bf &amp; I recently moved in
together&amp; are having a bonfire tn with a few of his friends. His ex roommate
has been dating this girl on&amp;off the past year or so. Ive had minimal
interactions w her but everytime ive seen her in person she says nothing to me
unless I say hi first then shell say hi. Shes told my bfs roommate from the get
go that shes worried he wants to date me&amp;that im flirting w him. Both my
bf&amp; his room mate know this isnt true. My bf and I have a really good
relationship&amp; theres never been attraction or flirtation between me&amp;his
room mate or any1 else for that matter  Room mates gf has messaged me several
times on fb telling me she knows im attracted to her bf &amp; that I exclude her
by not saying hi when I see her(shes referencing a time when she didnt hear me
say hi&amp; found it rude). She doesnt believe me or my bf when we tell her im
not attracted to her bf. She also asked me to stop talking to her bf &amp; i
told her im not going to ignore him when im at my bfs house &amp; his rm-mate
starts talking to both of us.   She even snooped so far back on my fb &amp;
found a post I shared 10 or so years ago &amp; sent it to her bf w no context,
asking him if he liked it&amp;when he said yeah she told him i had posted it(It
wasnt even my original post, i just shared smthing). Her mssges&amp;stalking my
fb were so anxiety inducing at one point I blocked her. She then found me on
insta&amp;sent me a message telling me i was petty for blocking her,which I
didnt even notice until she screen shot it, sent it to my bf&amp;then blocked
him I unblocked her cause I felt bad and to explain why id blocked her in the
first place Also she wont say a single thing to me in person &amp;ive invited
her to hang w us several times but she never comes  Recently she &amp;her bf
broke up. Its happened a couple times &amp; im not super close w my bfs rm-mate
so I didnt think much of it until she sent me a message on fb telling me they
broke up&amp; asking me if I could find him someone else to date. This is like
within a week of them breaking up. I found this really weird and it made me even
more anxious. I responded by telling her my bf, who was still living w him,
could check on him&amp; left it at that  That brings us to the present. my bf
moved in last week &amp; we invited his ex room mate over for this bon fire. I
didnt think the gf would be a problem bc they arent 2gether but today he asked
if she could come with. my bf &amp; I both said no. He said this made her sad
&amp; he might not come  I really dont want her at my hosue. Shes made me so
anxious &amp; it honestly makes me feel crazy that she even asked to come w
after everything My bf is more chill abt her coming over but hes also supportive
of me not wanting to see her  AITA? Should I let her come over? I feel bad that
my bfs friend isnt gonna come now &amp; im worried shes gonna isolate him from
his friends esp if hes living alone now

Opposing side:

The original poster is the YTA because they are allowing their personal feelings
and anxieties about the girlfriend to dictate who can attend a social gathering
at their home. While it's understandable to feel uncomfortable given the
history, excluding someone solely based on assumptions and past interactions is
unfair and could harm their boyfriend's friendships. By not allowing the
girlfriend to come, they are prioritizing their own discomfort over their
boyfriend's social connections, which could be detrimental to his relationships
and overall well-being. It would be more mature to find a way to coexist
peacefully at the gathering, rather than creating further division.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the last YTA claims that the original
poster (OP) is prioritizing their feelings over their boyfriend's friendships,
it overlooks the fact that the OP has a right to establish boundaries in their
own home. The OP's discomfort stems from a valid concern about past behavior
that directly affects their emotional well-being. It's not about denying social
connections, but rather about ensuring a safe space for themselves, which is a
reasonable request.  New concise argument for OP not being at fault: The OP is
not at fault because they are safeguarding their mental health in their own
living space. It is entirely reasonable for individuals to set boundaries with
people who have previously caused them distress. By prioritizing their comfort
and safety, the OP is taking necessary steps to maintain a healthy environment,
which should be respected by their partner and his friends.

The original poster (OP) is at fault because they are allowing their past
experiences to dictate their actions in a way that negatively impacts their
boyfriend's social life and relationships. While it’s important to feel safe and
comfortable in one’s own home, the OP's decision to exclude the girlfriend
reflects a lack of empathy and an unwillingness to move past previous conflicts.
Instead of addressing their feelings directly with their boyfriend and
considering a compromise, the OP is creating unnecessary tension and division
within their boyfriend's social circle.  Refuting the last NTA argument: The
previous argument suggests that the OP is entitled to set boundaries in their
own home, but it fails to recognize that relationships often require compromise
and understanding. By excluding the girlfriend, the OP is not only disregarding
their boyfriend's feelings but also potentially isolating him from his friends.
Healthy relationships should accommodate the needs of both partners, and the
OP’s refusal to allow the girlfriend to attend reflects an unwillingness to
engage in that necessary give-and-take, which ultimately undermines the
relationship.  New concise argument for OP being at fault: The OP is at fault
because they are allowing fear and past grievances to control their actions,
which ultimately harms their boyfriend’s ability to maintain meaningful
friendships. Instead of fostering a spirit of inclusion and understanding, the
OP’s decision to exclude the girlfriend creates an unhealthy dynamic that
prioritizes their discomfort over the relationship’s growth and the boyfriend's
social connections. A more constructive approach would involve open
communication and a willingness to find a solution that respects both partners'
needs.

establish boundaries in their own home, especially when a past interaction with
the girlfriend was harmful to them. It’s essential for individuals to feel safe
and comfortable in their personal space, and the OP's decision to exclude the
girlfriend is a way of protecting their mental health from potential triggers.
Refuting the last YTA argument: The last YTA argument suggests that the OP's
actions harm the boyfriend’s friendships and reflect a lack of empathy. However,
this perspective fails to consider that the OP's feelings are valid and deserve
acknowledgment. It’s not just about social connections; it’s about creating an
environment where the OP feels secure. The OP's discomfort is rooted in past
experiences, and it is crucial for their boyfriend to understand and respect
those feelings rather than dismiss them for the sake of social harmony.  New
concise argument for OP not being at fault: The OP is not at fault because they

emotional safety. It is reasonable for someone to choose not to host individuals
who have previously made them uncomfortable, and this decision is essential for
maintaining their mental health. By prioritizing their well-being, the OP is
advocating for a healthy environment, which is a necessary aspect of any
relationship.

argument claims that the OP is entitled to set boundaries in their own home, but
it neglects the fact that relationships are about collaboration and mutual
respect. By choosing to exclude the girlfriend rather than addressing their

interactions with their boyfriend's girlfriend have understandably led to

Moderator Summary: - Winner: NTA - Strength: 0.00% vs 100.00% - Reasoning: The
NTA argument emphasized the importance of setting boundaries for personal safety
and mental health, especially given the past negative experiences with the
girlfriend. This perspective aligns with the need for emotional well-being in
one's living space. The YTA argument failed to provide a compelling reason for
why the OP should compromise their comfort, focusing instead on the boyfriend’s
social connections without adequately addressing the OP's valid concerns.
Ultimately, the NTA stance was stronger due to its prioritization of the OP's
well-being and the necessity of boundaries in relationships.

- **Prioritize Your Well-being:** It’s crucial to maintain your emotional safety
and mental health. If the presence of your boyfriend’s girlfriend in shared
spaces is a source of discomfort due to past negative experiences, it's
completely valid to set boundaries.  - **Communicate Clearly:** Have an honest
discussion with your boyfriend about why you feel uncomfortable. Explain the
importance of your living environment being a safe and peaceful space for you.
- **Establish Boundaries:** Clearly define what you're comfortable with
regarding social interactions in your shared space. It's okay to ask for limits,
especially if it affects your well-being.  - **Encourage Respect for Your
Needs:** Remind your boyfriend that your comfort should be valued in the
relationship, just as his needs are important too.  - **Evaluate Your
Relationship:** Consider whether your boyfriend respects your boundaries. If he
dismisses your concerns or prioritizes social connections over your comfort, it
might be worth reflecting on the overall dynamics of your relationship.   -
**Seek Support if Needed:** If conversations with your boyfriend are challenging
or unproductive, consider talking to a trusted friend or a professional for
additional support and guidance.
