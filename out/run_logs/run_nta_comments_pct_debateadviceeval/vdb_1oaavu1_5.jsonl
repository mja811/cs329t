{"selftext": "I recently got a new neighbor a few months ago. Overall I haven't had any problems with them. They a young single mother with a small child. Then they started this pattern of playing loud music during the day from time to time. Its not bothersome but I had to ask them to lower it a bit today because I could even here it in the hall. She was apologetic and turned it down. Then came last night. She started blaring the music at 11am. By 3am, I had had enough. I went up to her apartment and knocked on her door. She was entertaining a friend. They never came to the door but I could hear them badmouthing me on the other side. I went back to my apartment and emailed my landlord about the disturbance. I felt like I could have handled things in a civil manner if she had just come to the door instead of clearing saying, \"I'm an adult and I can do what I want in my own home\" to her friend. I clearly heard it.

{"selftext": "Tonight my downstairs housemate (28f) texted me (25f) to be quiet because she could hear me 'doing laps around my room or moving furniture' at 10:40pm. Problem is, I wasn't doing that.   I tend to go to bed at 11, so at 10:30-45ish I get ready for bed by putting on my pajamas, walking to the bathroom to brush my teeth, walking back, doing skincare, generally just being upright and moving around the room. At most the amount of 'furniture moved' is me opening and closing the wardrobe door.   Tonight I happened to be listening to a podcast while I was doing it, so I know for a fact I had only been 'making noise' for around 12 minutes before she texted me.   Personally I don't think it's unreasonable to spend 10-15 minutes every night getting ready for bed. I will also say that this 10-15 minutes is the only time I'm moving around my room at all in the evening. I spend the entire rest of the time just sat being quiet. I always listen to music and podcasts with headphones. I can for sure understand that it must be annoying to hear footsteps when you're trying to sleep but I personally think that before 11pm is kind of fair game?   Anyway, I replied to her saying sorry and I genuinely felt really bad about it for a while but the more I think about it the more I don't think I'm in the wrong? But am I just really misjudging this and it's totally inappropriate to make noise in a share house after 10pm? AITA?  Edit: Lots of people are speculating about the floor! It's carpeted, but the carpet is thin and probably really old so might not be helping much. Also, I always either wear slippers or socks indoors and tonight was wearing slippers.", "post_id": "1ojlbdq", "title": "AITA for walking around my room at night?", "flair": "Not the A-hole", "created_utc": 1761783551, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ojlbdq/aita_for_walking_around_my_room_at_night/", "downs": 0, "ups": 275, "score": 275}
{"selftext": "I have two young kiddos and live in a bottom floor apartment of a complex. We can be loud sometimes during the day but they are in bed by 8 pm. They sleep through the night and don't make noise until they wake up around 6 am. We keep it as quiet as possible until quiet hours are over . Inevitably sometimes there is crying or playing through out the day. My upstairs neighbors however play video games with alot of bass at all hours of the day/night. I've awoken at all hours of the night from the noise, most recently at 2 am. While we are not the quietest of neighbors, we respect the quiet time hours. Once I filed a complaint with the property management, they made similar claims. I am genuinely concerned my kids and I will be kicked out for making noise during the day.

{"selftext": "I (f27) share an apartment with my friend (f25). She has been dating her boyfriend since February. In the beginning he would occasionally stay over (one/two nights per week) and she would sleep at his place once/twice per week. This summer they went on vacation together and they have been inseparable ever since. Having dinner and spending the night together every single night, 50/50 at our place and his place (he owns a studio by himself about a 45 minute drive away). There is nothing in our lease about guests or key-usage by third parties.  After the summer she told me she had given him spare keys because he finishes work a little bit earlier than she does, and it would be more practical if he can come here without having to wait 30 minutes. I was not amused to say the least, I had a conversation with her she has to communicate such things beforehand and that it really wasn't cool because they were actually my keys (she thought they were spare keys for general usage). We agreed it was alright if he had keys for those 30 minutes now and then if it would be more practical to let himself in, but that I didn't want him unattended for prolonged periods of time because he is still a guest after all.  Fast forward to today, my roommate leaves to go to the gym, and 5 minutes later I hear him come into our home and start cooking. After a good 2 hours I come into the living room and notice my roommate still hasn't returned. It was not the first time, so I felt like I was well within my right to set this boundary again. I calmly asked him if he was aware of the agreements about the keys, to which he said he wasn't. In the middle of that conversation my roommate returns. I calmly explained to the two of them we made clear agreements, but that this was really pushing my limits and that I felt uncomfortable, 2 hours of him being here while she is out at the gym is not the 30 minutes that would be more practical with work-schedules. It is not what we agreed upon, I feel uncomfortable, please come up with a solution, that's it. All explained very calmly, no raised voice, no unnecessary accusing, no derailing from the topic.   The two of them reacted quite vicious, that she wasn't aware I would take our agreement so literally, that they didn't see another solution (mind you, they made it work for 5 months before he had keys), that they really didn't see the problem, that he always stayed in her room if he was here so early (he wouldn't have to stay in her room for 2 hours if they would stick to the agreements). Then they flipped the script on me, what I think would be a good solution, and how I would be if I had a boyfriend. I calmly explained it is their relationship and their schedules, they should arrange something that fits all of our boundaries accordingly. They finished by saying I am unreasonable for bringing it up and that they for sure would get back to me.   It has left quite a sour aftertaste and now I'm not sure anymore if I'm not overreacting...", "post_id": "1ohsysf", "title": "AITA for not wanting my roommate's boyfriend in our home unsupervised?", "flair": "Not the A-hole", "created_utc": 1761604971, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ohsysf/aita_for_not_wanting_my_roommates_boyfriend_in/", "downs": 0, "ups": 249, "score": 249}
