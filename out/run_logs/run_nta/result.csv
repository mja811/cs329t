1oad7wt,AITA for telling my mom her boyfriend isn't welcome to events anymore?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oad7wt/aita_for_telling_my_mom_her_boyfriend_isnt/,NTA,YTA,False,"I, (28F) have recently told my mother her I will no longer be going out to see her at her home, where she and her boyfriend, let's call him Fred, live, and he is no longer welcome to come here under any circumstance. For context, my mom lives about an hour away, and with work schedules and all, we don't see each other too often to start. Now, she and ""Fred"", have been together for about 6 years, and have lived together for about 5, and she made the move out of town to be with him. Since myself and my younger brother were already grown and out of the house already, and she has been seeing him for a year already, they were making plans to move in together, but since his kids were younger, I believe 18 and 16 at the time, it made sense for her to move out there. We were all fond of Fred when she had introduced him, and after her long history with abusive relationships, he seemed like a great change, and we were happy for her. My mom, relocating, didn't know anyone out there other than Fred and his family, and since relocating had to start a new job. Everything seemed fine until fast forward a year or so when his behavior started to change. He is constantly accusing her of cheating (despite never doing so), always questioning her whereabouts, and even makes comments about her weight. So over the years, I would get phone calls of her crying, and saying how she can't do it anymore. Her being my mother, I always tried to help, and even offered for her to stay with me and my family until she found something for herself. But, he'd apologize , and all was forgiven. This has happened about a dozen times in the last 5 years, and always she forgives him, and everything is all dandy again.  Now, fast forward to a few weeks ago. I got one of these phone calls, again, and so did my brother. This time seemed like it was it. So myself, brother, sister in-law and my husband were making plans to get her out and to set her up back here in our town. But low and behold, two days later, he apologized and everything was forgiven, again. So my brother and I had said enough was enough, and if she was ever serious about leaving, we will 100% be there for her, and she is always welcome here to visit, but is no longer welcome, since we cannot pretend to fake nice to a man who treats our mother like garbage. I also have two young children who have started to ask why he says mean things to their grandma, and said I don't want her to model that type of relationship to them. But she has sense said I'm being, quote ""immature, mean, and that is uncalled for since he's 'trying"""", and is telling other family members I'm trying to cut her out, when I have said she is still always welcome. AITA for saying he cannot come anymore? Or should I just bare it for the sake of not losing my mother and the relationship with her grandkids?",,"The original poster is the one at fault because they are attempting to control their mother's personal relationships instead of supporting her in making her own choices. While it's understandable to be concerned about a loved one's well-being, dictating who is welcome in her life can push her away and damage their relationship. It's essential to respect her autonomy, even if her decisions are not what the original poster agrees with. Instead of alienating her by banning her boyfriend, the poster should focus on being a supportive figure, encouraging her to make healthy choices without ultimatums.

Refuting the last YTA argument: The assertion that the original poster is trying to control their mother's relationships overlooks the fact that the poster's concerns are based on valid observations about the boyfriend’s behavior and its potential impact on their mother's well-being. Expressing concern for a loved one is not controlling; it's a protective instinct that stems from care and a desire for their safety. The original poster is not trying to dictate who their mother can see but is rather advocating for her health and happiness, which is a responsible and caring position.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because they are acting out of concern for their mother’s well-being. It is entirely reasonable for a child to be protective when they perceive a relationship as harmful. By voicing their worries, the poster is fulfilling their responsibility as a caring family member, ensuring that their mother's choices are informed and safe, rather than passively accepting potentially damaging situations.Refuting the last NTA argument: While the original poster's concerns for their mother's well-being are valid, the approach taken—essentially issuing an ultimatum—can be counterproductive. Instead of fostering open communication, it risks creating conflict and resentment. Rather than being protective, the poster's actions may be perceived as controlling, which can lead to further estrangement. It’s crucial to recognize that expressing concern should not come at the cost of pushing the loved one away.

New concise argument: The original poster is at fault because they are prioritizing their own feelings and judgments over their mother's autonomy. While they may believe they have her best interests at heart, the approach of banning her boyfriend undermines her ability to make her own choices. This not only disrespects her independence but also diminishes the trust and support necessary for a healthy parent-child relationship. Healthy boundaries and communication are essential, and the poster should engage with their mother instead of attempting to impose their will.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the original poster’s approach may seem controlling, it is essential to recognize that their concerns stem from genuine care for their mother's well-being. The poster is not simply issuing an ultimatum; they are trying to protect their mother from a potentially harmful relationship. This protective instinct, grounded in love, should not be misconstrued as a desire to control but rather as a heartfelt attempt to ensure her safety and happiness.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because they are advocating for their mother's emotional health in the face of a troubling relationship. It is entirely appropriate to voice concerns when a loved one is involved with someone who may not have their best interests at heart. Instead of being a matter of control, the poster's actions reflect a responsible and caring attitude towards their mother, aiming to prevent her from facing potential harm. Supporting loved ones includes addressing unsafe situations, and the poster's intentions to protect their mother are commendable.Refuting the last NTA argument: While the original poster's protective instincts are commendable, the manner in which they express these concerns can be seen as controlling rather than supportive. By issuing an ultimatum about their mother's boyfriend, the poster risks creating an adversarial relationship instead of fostering open dialogue. This approach may alienate their mother and make her less likely to confide in or seek advice from the poster in the future. It's important to balance concern with respect for her autonomy to ensure a healthy relationship.

New concise argument: The original poster is at fault because they are failing to respect their mother's autonomy and ability to make her own choices. While concern for a loved one’s well-being is valid, attempting to dictate her relationships undermines her independence and can lead to resentment. A healthier approach would involve expressing concerns while allowing her the space to make her own decisions, which would foster trust and open communication rather than creating division and conflict.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it is acknowledged that the original poster's concerns for their mother's well-being come from a place of care, it is important to understand that the method of expressing these concerns—through ultimatums—can be perceived as controlling. This approach may inadvertently push the mother further away instead of fostering a supportive environment. Healthy relationships thrive on mutual respect and trust, which can be compromised by attempts to dictate personal choices.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because they are acting in the best interest of their mother's emotional and mental health. By voicing concerns about a potentially harmful relationship, the poster is fulfilling a protective role that is often inherent in family dynamics. Rather than simply trying to control their mother’s choices, the poster is advocating for her well-being, which is a responsible and caring action. Encouraging a conversation about her relationship, rather than issuing ultimatums, demonstrates a commitment to her happiness and safety.Refuting the last NTA argument: While the original poster’s intentions may be rooted in care, the manner in which they express these concerns—through an ultimatum—can be seen as counterproductive. Instead of fostering an open dialogue, it risks creating defensiveness and pushing the mother away. The poster's approach could lead to further estrangement rather than the desired outcome of protecting their mother, illustrating a lack of understanding of how to effectively communicate care and concern.

New concise argument: The original poster is at fault because they are prioritizing their own feelings of concern over their mother's autonomy. By attempting to control who she can and cannot date, the poster undermines her ability to make informed choices about her own life. This not only disrespects her independence but also damages the trust in their relationship. A healthier approach would involve open communication about concerns while allowing their mother the space to make her own decisions, ultimately fostering a more supportive and trusting relationship.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the original poster's protective instincts are commendable, the assertion that they are acting out of genuine concern overlooks the potential harm caused by their controlling approach. The ultimatum issued creates an environment of conflict rather than support, which can alienate the mother and discourage open communication. Instead of fostering a trusting relationship, this method risks pushing her closer to the boyfriend, which is counterintuitive to the poster's intentions.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because their actions stem from a genuine concern for their mother's emotional and mental health. They are advocating for her well-being in the face of a relationship that they perceive as harmful. It is natural for family members to express worries about the choices of loved ones, especially when those choices may lead to negative outcomes. By voicing these concerns, the poster is demonstrating their care and responsibility as a family member, aiming to protect their mother from potential harm rather than simply exerting control.Refuting the last NTA argument: While the original poster’s concerns may stem from a place of care, the manner in which they express these concerns—through an ultimatum—can be interpreted as controlling behavior. This approach may create resistance from the mother, pushing her to defend her choices rather than engage in a constructive dialogue about the relationship. The intent to protect can quickly become counterproductive if it results in a breakdown of trust and communication.

New concise argument: The original poster is at fault because they are failing to respect their mother’s autonomy and ability to make her own decisions. While their concern for her well-being is valid, attempting to dictate her relationships undermines her independence and can lead to resentment. A more effective approach would involve expressing their concerns while allowing her the space to make her own choices, fostering a healthier dynamic based on mutual respect and understanding rather than control.

Refuting the last NTA argument: While it is true that the original poster's concerns come from a place of care, the argument fails to acknowledge that the ultimatum approach can create more harm than good. Instead of fostering open communication, this method can alienate the mother, leading her to feel cornered and defensive. A more supportive and effective strategy would be to express concerns without attempting to control her decisions, allowing for a healthier dialogue that respects her autonomy.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because they are acting out of genuine concern for their mother's emotional and mental well-being. It is reasonable for a child to express worries about a parent's relationship, especially when they perceive signs of possible harm. By raising these concerns, the poster demonstrates a caring attitude and a commitment to their mother's safety, which is a responsible action.

1o8lauo,AITA if I drop off a note and baked goods to my neighbor who made me pick up somebody else’s dog poop?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o8lauo/aita_if_i_drop_off_a_note_and_baked_goods_to_my/,YTA,YTA,True,"My SO (M33) and I (F32) moved into a new area. I’m careful about my dog going potty on lawns, I ALWAYS pick it up and bring extra bags. Tonight on our walk, our dog went potty immediately. Picked it up and looped around back towards our house from the other direction. Close to home he sniffed another dogs poo and we kept going.   We’re at our door when I hear somebody running up behind startling us. A guy is coming at us with “Your dog pooped on my lawn and you need to pick it up”. I say calmly, “I know for a fact that didn’t happen, you’ve got the wrong dog”. He insists it JUST HAPPENED, he saw it, and has it on camera. I say, “Let’s see the footage because I’m POSITIVE”. My SO didn’t want it to escalate so he says, “Let’s go take a look”. Neighbor puts his hand on my SO’s back and pushes him towards his house. They are of similar cultural background so maybe ok but I didn't like it. I look down and see I have our bag in my hand and yell ahead to them. They didn’t hear me or my SO didn’t want me to get involved. I take a breath, drop off the dog, and head back. If by some miracle my dog had gone without me noticing I would apologize and pick it up.   Neighbor shows me over to where it is and points to the poo in question, I shine my light and I can’t help but literally start laughing out loud. Every oz of diplomacy failed at that moment. It was white, dry, hard as a rock, and TINY. Obviously been sitting there for a long time and where I saw my dog smelling it. I said incredulously, *“*That’s not my dog’s poop, can’t you see how hard it is? It’s old”. He answers, “I’m not here to argue with you-just pick it up.” Now, I’m pissed. I know my SO hates when I argue with people, but I have a strong respect complex. I look this man dead in the face as I scoop it up and say, “Funny how you don’t want to ‘argue’ but you want to make me pick up somebody else’s DOG SHIT. Where’s the camera footage? Would love to see it”. Then my SO hurries me away towards home.  He tells me we should be the bigger people and reminds me there’s so many bigger things in life. Says he also laughed, told him it was super old and also made it clear we didn’t do it. Told him “you must be having a hard time with this issue if you’re having to literally run after people. I’m sorry this happens to you so much”. SO doesn’t let things like that get to him and always feels bad for the out of line person. I often feel the need to correct them. In the grand scheme of things it’s just a piece of poo. But the principle is what gets me. Now here’s where I might be an ahole: I’m considering baking him treats and dropping them with a note like “I’m the bigger person we got off on the wrong foot but you’re still totally wrong and I’m not the one”. My SO thinks it isn’t necessary, and we should ignore him. I’m not trying to start anything bigger but I’m also not a doormat. So Reddit, AITA if I drop off a note and baked goods to my neighbor who made me pick up somebody else’s dog poop?",,"The original poster is the AH because instead of addressing the situation with maturity and understanding, they chose to escalate it by confronting the neighbor and insisting on their innocence in a condescending manner. Baking treats and leaving a note is passive-aggressive, undermining the original intent of fostering a neighborly relationship. Instead of resolving conflict, they are perpetuating negativity and potentially creating more tension in the community. A better approach would have been to calmly discuss the misunderstanding without the need for vindication or condescension.

While the previous YTA argument suggests that the original poster's (OP's) actions were condescending and immature, it's important to recognize that the OP was responding to an unfair accusation. The OP's choice to bake treats and leave a note was not passive-aggressive but rather an attempt to diffuse tension and foster goodwill. 

**New Argument:** The OP demonstrated a commendable approach to conflict resolution by choosing a thoughtful gesture instead of escalating the situation further. Rather than resorting to anger or retaliation, the OP prioritized community harmony, showing that they value neighborly relationships. This proactive and kind response reflects emotional maturity and a willingness to bridge gaps, rather than being at fault.The original poster is at fault because their approach to the situation lacked accountability and empathy. While baking treats might seem like a friendly gesture, it can also be perceived as dismissive of the neighbor's concerns. Instead of taking a moment to reflect on the situation and acknowledge the neighbor's feelings, the OP chose to respond with a passive gesture that sidesteps the initial conflict. This not only undermines the seriousness of the neighbor's complaint but also avoids an opportunity for constructive dialogue. A genuine resolution requires open communication, and the OP's actions suggest they were more focused on proving their innocence than on understanding the neighbor's perspective.

While the previous YTA argument suggests that the original poster (OP) lacked accountability and empathy, it's crucial to recognize the context in which the OP acted. The OP was unfairly accused, and rather than retaliating or escalating tensions, they chose to respond with a gesture of goodwill by baking treats. This shows a level of maturity and a desire to maintain peace in the neighborhood.

**New Argument:** The OP's actions reflect a proactive approach to conflict resolution. By baking treats and leaving a note, they demonstrated an intention to foster positive relationships rather than deepen the divide. This gesture is a constructive way to address misunderstandings, showing that the OP values community harmony and is willing to extend an olive branch, which is commendable rather than faultful.The original poster is at fault because their approach to the situation lacked genuine engagement with the neighbor's concerns. Baking treats and leaving a note can be seen as an attempt to gloss over the issue rather than addressing it directly. By choosing a passive gesture instead of having an open conversation, the OP avoids taking responsibility for the misunderstanding and misses the opportunity to clear the air. This not only dismisses the neighbor's feelings but also perpetuates a cycle of miscommunication. A sincere dialogue would have shown a willingness to understand and resolve the issue, rather than sidestepping it with a superficial gesture.

While the previous YTA argument critiques the original poster (OP) for avoiding direct engagement, it overlooks the essential context of the OP's actions. The OP was responding to an unfair accusation, and their gesture of baking treats was a thoughtful way to diffuse tension rather than escalate conflict.

**New Argument:** The OP's choice to bake treats and leave a note is an example of emotional intelligence and a desire to foster positive relationships. Instead of retaliating or confronting the neighbor aggressively, the OP demonstrated kindness and a willingness to bridge the gap created by the misunderstanding. This approach shows that the OP values harmony in the community and is committed to resolving conflicts in a non-confrontational manner, which is commendable and not at fault.The original poster is at fault because their decision to bake treats and leave a note was an inadequate response to the neighbor's concerns. Instead of addressing the issue directly, the OP chose a passive approach that sidesteps the fundamental problem. This can come off as dismissive, suggesting that the OP does not take the neighbor's feelings seriously. A genuine resolution requires open communication and acknowledgment of the other party's perspective, which the OP failed to provide. By avoiding a direct conversation, the OP missed an opportunity to clarify the misunderstanding and build a more meaningful relationship with their neighbor.

While the previous YTA argument suggests that the original poster (OP) was at fault for not addressing the neighbor's concerns directly, it fails to consider the intention behind the OP's actions. The OP was faced with an unfair accusation and chose to respond with kindness rather than confrontation, which is a constructive way to handle conflict.

**New Argument:** The OP's gesture of baking treats was an attempt to foster goodwill and demonstrate a desire for neighborly harmony in the face of conflict. Instead of escalating the situation with anger or defensiveness, the OP opted for a peaceful approach, recognizing that sometimes kindness can lead to better communication in the long run. This decision reflects emotional maturity and a commitment to resolving misunderstandings amicably, indicating that the OP is not at fault.The original poster is at fault because their response to the neighbor’s concerns was superficial and avoided the underlying issue. By choosing to bake treats and leave a note instead of having a direct conversation, the OP dismissed the neighbor's feelings and perpetuated the misunderstanding. This approach can come off as patronizing, suggesting that the OP believes a simple gesture can replace meaningful dialogue. A more responsible and mature response would have been to engage the neighbor in an open discussion to address the concerns directly, demonstrating respect for their feelings and a willingness to resolve the conflict authentically.

While the previous YTA argument claims that the original poster (OP) avoided the underlying issue by opting for a superficial gesture, it overlooks the context of the situation.

1o8l7hm,AITA: I accidentally bad-mouthed one of the other clubs and the coach overheard me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o8l7hm/aita_i_accidentally_badmouthed_one_of_the_other/,YTA,YTA,True,"Context: I have been training waterpolo for about a year, and where i am there are 4 major clubs that do not represent the country. For the sake of privacy i will reference them as club 1,2,3 and 4 and they are not ranked based on skill or anything like that. Im not the best by any means, infact i think of myself as the worst one there, but i have experience playing for all of them other than club 1.  Now onto the story. So finnaly after one year of being the newest member of club 2, someone else decided to join. This got me excited, and after practice was over i went over to him and decided to be a good teammate and talk to him so he feels welcomed into the club. We met in the lobby after we got dressed from practice and talked a decent bit. I decided to tell him how i got my first golden medal. I told him that even though i play for club 2, on the yearly/grand tournament my coach decided to let the other teams borrow me for 2 reasons: i was the newest one there, being the least of value; and the other clubs where missing players. To be specific, team 3 which was a mixed club (men and women) was missing a goalkeeper, and also the rest of the club wasn't that sharp either as i was faster than all of them during warmups, and team 4 which litteraly had HALF of their players borrowed from either club 1 or 2. Due to these reasons i told him that here there are basically 2 good clubs, club 1 and 2, and that the others suck. (Now even though i barely played for my team, i still won gold because my team won gold, but i dont think this is relevant to the story)  Well as it turns out the coach for team 4 happened to be in the lobby, and when he heard what i said he got defensive and told us that thier club will be good, and that i was playing against thier underaged players.  I feel bad that he heard that, and of course no body wants to hear bas stuff about themselves or something they've poured time into and also because i played for them in the tournament, but i feel like what i said was only the truth as yes, they do suck in comparison to club 1 and 2, while also furhter proving my point as due to the fact that they needed to borrow players in the first olace meant they weren't good enough to compete in the first olace. Also i think that i said nothing wrong - only the trith that happens to be cold and harsh. It wasnt directed as an insult, but only the truth so the new teammate could get a better understanding of the competition.  So am i the asshole?",,"The original poster is at fault because their comments about the other clubs were unnecessarily harsh and disrespectful, regardless of their intent. Bad-mouthing other teams, especially in front of a new teammate and a coach, fosters a negative environment and undermines the spirit of sportsmanship. Instead of focusing on their own team's strengths, the OP chose to highlight the weaknesses of others, which is unprofessional and damaging to the community within the sport. Even if the OP felt it was the truth, there are more constructive ways to discuss competition without belittling others.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster’s comments may have been perceived as harsh, but context matters significantly. The OP may have been trying to motivate their team by emphasizing areas for improvement, not to belittle other clubs. In a competitive environment, discussing strengths and weaknesses can be a way to foster growth and resilience within a team. The intention behind the comments is crucial; if the OP aimed to inspire rather than insult, that should be taken into account.

Additionally, the OP's comments could be seen as a form of team bonding. By discussing perceived weaknesses of rival teams, they may have been trying to build camaraderie within their own team, encouraging a united front. This creates an atmosphere where teammates can rally together and face challenges collectively, which is often vital in sports.

In summary, the original poster is not at fault as their intentions likely stemmed from a desire to motivate their team and foster unity, rather than to disrespect other clubs.The original poster is at fault because their comments, regardless of intent, perpetuate a toxic culture in sports. By criticizing other teams openly, they risk demoralizing their own teammates and creating division rather than unity. Sports are not just about competition; they also involve respect and camaraderie among players, coaches, and teams. The OP missed an opportunity to promote a positive mindset and instead chose to engage in disparaging remarks that could lead to negativity within their own team. Even if they believed they were motivating their teammates, there are far more constructive ways to foster a competitive spirit without resorting to belittling others.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's essential to consider the context of the original poster’s comments. While the OP may have been perceived as harsh, their intention was likely to foster a competitive spirit within their team rather than to belittle others. In many sports environments, discussing rival teams' weaknesses can serve as a motivational tool, inspiring teammates to recognize their own potential and strive for improvement. 

Moreover, the original poster's comments could have been a way to build team cohesion. By openly discussing competition, the OP may have aimed to encourage dialogue and strategizing among teammates, which can strengthen their bond and collective focus. The intent behind the remarks is crucial; if the OP's goal was to uplift and motivate, that context should mitigate any perceived negativity.

In conclusion, the original poster is not at fault because their comments likely stemmed from a desire to motivate and unite their team, rather than to insult or disrespect rival clubs. Encouraging healthy competition and camaraderie is a vital aspect of sportsmanship.The original poster is at fault because their comments, regardless of intent, foster a negative culture that undermines the principles of sportsmanship. While they may have aimed to motivate their teammates by discussing weaknesses of rival clubs, this approach ultimately promotes a toxic environment where belittling others becomes acceptable. 

Moreover, by focusing on criticizing other teams instead of emphasizing their own team’s strengths and areas for improvement, the OP misses the opportunity to build a more positive and supportive atmosphere. Healthy competition should be rooted in respect for opponents, and the OP’s comments could discourage a sense of community and collaboration, not just within their team but across the broader sports community.

In summary, the original poster’s choice to engage in disparaging remarks about other teams reflects a lack of respect and sportsmanship, making them at fault for contributing to a negative dynamic.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s important to recognize that the original poster’s comments were likely intended to foster camaraderie and motivation within their team, rather than to disrespect other clubs. In competitive sports, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of rivals can serve as a strategy to galvanize team spirit and encourage players to rise to challenges together. The OP may have believed that highlighting these aspects could inspire their teammates to focus on their own performance and improvement.

Additionally, the context in which the OP made their comments is crucial. If the discussion was casual and meant to lighten the mood or share insights, the intent was not malicious. Team dynamics often thrive on open conversations about competition, and the OP’s approach could be seen as an attempt to engage and rally the team.

In conclusion, the original poster is not at fault because their comments likely stemmed from a desire to motivate and unite their team rather than to demean others. Emphasizing competition can be a healthy part of sports if approached with the right intent.The original poster is at fault because their comments contribute to a culture of disrespect and negativity in sports. While they may have intended to motivate their team by discussing the weaknesses of rival clubs, this approach undermines the principles of good sportsmanship. Rather than fostering a positive environment, the OP's remarks can alienate teammates who may not share the same views or who may feel uncomfortable with the negativity directed at other teams.

Furthermore, criticizing other clubs in front of a new teammate and a coach can create an impression of arrogance and entitlement, which can damage team dynamics. It sets a poor example for younger or less experienced players about how to conduct themselves in competitive settings. Instead of building their team up, the OP’s comments risk fostering a hostile atmosphere that detracts from the true spirit of sports—respect for opponents and the joy of competition.

In summary, the original poster's choice to openly criticize rival teams reflects a lack of consideration for the values of sportsmanship and teamwork, making them at fault in this situation.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s crucial to recognize that the original poster’s comments were likely intended to foster a sense of unity and motivation rather than to belittle other teams. In competitive sports, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of rivals can serve as a strategy to encourage teammates to sharpen their focus and improve their performance. The OP’s intention may have been to inspire their team to rise to challenges, which is a common practice in sports environments.

Moreover, the context in which these comments were made matters significantly. If the OP was speaking casually amongst teammates, their remarks might have been meant to lighten the atmosphere and encourage open dialogue about competition. In many cases, such discussions can help build team cohesion and enhance strategic thinking.

In conclusion, the original poster is not at fault because their comments likely stemmed from a desire to motivate and strengthen team bonds rather than to insult others. Acknowledging competition is an integral part of sportsmanship when approached with the right intent.The original poster is at fault because their comments contribute to a culture of negativity and disrespect in sports, regardless of their intent to motivate their team. By openly criticizing other clubs, the OP not only risks alienating teammates who may feel uncomfortable with such disparagement but also sets a poor example of sportsmanship for newer team members. 

Moreover, this type of commentary can damage relationships within the broader sports community. Sports should be about mutual respect and camaraderie, and the OP's choice to belittle rivals undermines those values. Instead of fostering a positive atmosphere where teammates can support one another and focus on their own growth, the OP's remarks create a divisive environment that can ultimately harm team morale and cohesion.

In summary, the original poster's decision to make derogatory comments about other teams reflects a lack of respect for the principles of fair competition and teamwork, making them at fault in this situation.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to understand that the original poster's comments were likely intended to foster motivation and camaraderie within their team, rather than to disparage other clubs. In competitive sports, discussing the perceived weaknesses of rivals can serve as a rallying point for teammates, encouraging them to focus on their own growth and performance. The OP may have believed that highlighting these aspects could inspire their teammates to elevate their game.

Additionally, the context of the OP's remarks matters. If these comments were made during a team discussion meant to strategize or bond, they might not have been intended maliciously. Engaging in open conversations about competition can be a valuable part of team dynamics, helping players to learn from each other and build a stronger collective identity.

In conclusion, the original poster is not at fault because their comments likely stemmed from a desire to motivate and unite their team, rather than to insult or disrespect rival clubs. Encouraging healthy competition and dialogue is a vital aspect of sportsmanship when approached with the right intent.","{'score': 2, 'criteria': 'The answer contains minimal grounding, as it largely expresses subjective opinions without factual support.', 'supporting_evidence': 'The response fails to cite specific examples of sporting culture or rules regarding sportsmanship, relying instead on general assertions about respect and camaraderie.'}","- Winner: YTA

1o8l5d7,AITA for not wanting to pay my opiate addict mom 400 dollars rent?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o8l5d7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_my_opiate_addict_mom/,YTA,YTA,True,"I’m 20 years old and my mom has been an addict for as long as i can remember. When i turned 18 she lost 1000 dollars a month from her social security so it was a big change. I finally have a part time job and make about 400 dollars each check (give or take bcz i don’t have a set amount of hours.) My mom is demanding half of every check and i don’t want to give it to her as she is an opioid addict. And quite frankly has never been good with money. She already spends my 160 that i get on my food card every month by ordering name brand groceries and so much meat and fruit that goes to waste.   On top of that my friend who lives with us also pays her rent. My mom never asked for me to pay rent until 1. she got her other pain meds cut off and 2. when my friend moved in and started paying her rent.   My mom also went bankrupt for the second time a few months ago. She is already talking about getting a loan for a car while her license is also suspended. I don’t feel comfy paying a drug addict that i know very well half of my pay check.   I get that she is in pain and has back issues and surgeries coming up and  she really does want to get clean but im tired of seeing no progress and trusting her word. Not even two days latter my friend gave her 400 she was coming to me saying she had no money for cigs or umo fare.   She gets mad when i talk about moving and saying why would i want to pay rent somewhere else and it’s gonna be more. I know it will be more but giving the living situation i am in current, it’s not worth a dime.   On top of it all i found out that i am pregnant so i really can’t be living here and like this nor am i gonna be giving her money that i will need more than ever to someone who doesn’t know how to budget and is just gonna spend it on drugs. Every morning day and night i have to check on her making sure shes not folded like a lawn chair. I can’t take care of a kid and her.   Edit: In no way do I plan on staying here for very long especially if she doesn’t start taking big steps very soon. My bf really wants to be here for me and step up and get better job so we can get our own place. I am gonna ask my boss to move up to full time so I can better prepare for my next steps aswell. I know i am not responsible but I never needed to be before and I am gonna do everything I can to make this life worth living for me and my kid.   And tbh all i am seeing in the comments is stuff that i am fundamentally aware of, so it’s more so just solidifying stuff i already know and will need to do. So everyone telling me this is a bad situation and that i am irresponsible. I KNOW THAT, that is why things need to change and I want to change them FAST.   At this point it’s not even about the rent money or if i am the asshole. i just wanted to hear everything i already know so i don’t feel like im just abandoning her for no reason. It’s so unfair that i am the one that was left with this, so proud of my sibling for getting out but god this just sucks all around.   I’ll be sure to update yall when i make it out✌️",,"While it's understandable that the original poster feels overwhelmed by their situation, they are still responsible for their choices and their mother’s welfare. As a family member, it is important to support loved ones, especially when they are struggling with addiction. By refusing to contribute to rent, the original poster is not only neglecting their mother's immediate needs but also enabling a cycle of instability that could worsen their living situation. Instead of distancing themselves, they should seek to have open discussions about financial responsibility and potential solutions, rather than just abandoning their mother in a time of need.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s essential to recognize that the original poster's choices stem from a place of self-preservation and mental health. They may be feeling overwhelmed and unable to contribute financially without compromising their own well-being. Simply because one is a family member does not mean they are obligated to shoulder burdens that could jeopardize their own stability. The original poster’s decision to prioritize their own mental health does not equate to neglect; rather, it is a necessary boundary to maintain their own well-being.

Furthermore, the original poster's refusal to contribute financially can be seen as a step towards encouraging their mother to seek help and become more self-sufficient. By not enabling potentially destructive behaviors through financial support, they may be promoting a healthier dynamic in the long run. In this context, the author's actions can be viewed as an attempt to foster accountability and encourage their mother to confront her challenges rather than perpetuating a cycle of dependency.Refuting the last NTA argument, it's important to acknowledge that while prioritizing one's mental health is crucial, the original poster's actions can still have significant consequences on their mother's well-being. By completely withdrawing financial support, the author might unintentionally be pushing their mother further into despair and instability, which can exacerbate her addiction issues. Instead of fostering accountability, this approach might lead to more harm than good, as their mother may feel abandoned and less motivated to seek help. 

A new concise argument for the author being at fault is that, as a family member, the original poster has a moral obligation to support their loved ones in difficult times, especially when they are battling addiction. While self-care is important, they must also find a balance between protecting their own mental health and providing necessary support to their mother. Ignoring this responsibility can lead to further deterioration of their relationship and their mother's situation, ultimately creating a cycle of pain that affects both parties.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s important to recognize that the original poster's choice to prioritize their own mental health does not equate to neglecting their mother's needs. By setting boundaries and not enabling their mother’s destructive behavior through financial support, they are taking a crucial step toward fostering a healthier dynamic. This decision can encourage the mother to seek the help she needs rather than remaining in a cycle of dependency.

Furthermore, a new concise argument for the author not being at fault is that the original poster has already been deeply impacted by their mother’s struggles with addiction. It's reasonable for them to recognize their limits and protect their mental health. Supporting a loved one does not mean sacrificing one's own well-being; rather, it involves finding a balance that allows them to care for themselves while still encouraging their mother to seek professional help. By stepping back, the original poster may be enabling their mother to take responsibility for her own life, which could ultimately lead to more positive outcomes for both of them.Refuting the last NTA argument, while the original poster may believe that distancing themselves from their mother’s addiction is a way to encourage her to seek help, it can also be seen as a form of abandonment. The reality is that addiction is a complex issue that often requires support from loved ones to navigate effectively. By refusing to assist their mother, the poster risks deepening her struggles and isolating her further, which may hinder her ability to seek the help she needs.

A new concise argument for the author being at fault is that familial relationships inherently involve some level of responsibility and support, especially during crises. While self-care is important, the original poster's complete withdrawal from their mother's life can be seen as a failure to show empathy in a time of need. Instead of walking away, they could have explored alternative ways to support their mother that wouldn't compromise their own mental health—such as encouraging her to seek professional help or finding community resources. By choosing to disengage entirely, the author is not only neglecting their mother’s needs but also missing an opportunity to foster healing within their family.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s important to acknowledge that while the original poster's decision to step back may seem like a form of abandonment, it is also a necessary boundary for their own mental health. Supporting someone struggling with addiction can be emotionally draining and detrimental to one’s own well-being. The poster’s choice to prioritize their mental health does not negate their care for their mother; rather, it reflects an understanding that they cannot help others effectively if they are not in a stable place themselves.

A new concise argument for the author not being at fault is that the original poster's actions can serve as a wake-up call for their mother. By refusing to provide financial support, they may be highlighting the seriousness of the situation and motivating their mother to confront her addiction more directly. Sometimes, tough love is necessary to encourage individuals to seek the help they need. The poster's choice not to enable their mother can be seen as an attempt to foster accountability, which may ultimately lead to healthier outcomes for both parties.Refuting the last NTA argument, while it's true that setting boundaries is crucial for maintaining one's mental health, the original poster's complete withdrawal from their mother's life can be detrimental in the long run. Addiction is a complicated issue that often requires the support of loved ones to navigate. By completely disengaging, the poster risks leaving their mother feeling isolated and unsupported, which could exacerbate her struggles rather than promote accountability. Support does not always mean financial assistance; emotional support can also play a vital role in encouraging someone to seek help.

A new concise argument for the author being at fault is that the original poster is neglecting the emotional and practical responsibilities that come with family ties. While self-care is essential, completely abandoning a loved one in crisis can lead to further deterioration of their situation. The poster should consider finding a middle ground, such as encouraging their mother to seek professional help or connecting her with community resources, rather than opting for total disengagement. By stepping back without offering alternatives or support, the original poster may be inadvertently contributing to their mother’s ongoing struggles rather than helping her find a path to recovery.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s crucial to highlight that while the original poster's focus on self-care is valid, their complete withdrawal from their mother’s life can perpetuate a cycle of addiction and despair. Addiction often thrives in isolation, and by stepping away entirely, the poster risks pushing their mother further into loneliness and desperation. Rather than abandoning her, the poster could explore ways to support her that don’t compromise their own mental health, such as encouraging her to seek professional help or connecting her with resources.

A new concise argument for the author not being at fault is that the original poster is taking a necessary stance to protect their own mental health, which is vital when dealing with a loved one’s addiction. They may have already faced emotional exhaustion from previous attempts to help, and recognizing their limits is a responsible choice. By refusing to enable their mother financially, they are asserting a boundary that can ultimately lead to healthier dynamics within the relationship. This decision can serve as a catalyst for their mother’s accountability and growth, rather than a mere abandonment.Refuting the last NTA argument, it's important to recognize that prioritizing one's mental health is crucial, but the original poster's complete disconnection from their mother's life can lead to severe consequences. Addiction is often exacerbated by feelings of isolation, and by withdrawing support entirely, the poster may inadvertently contribute to their mother's further decline. Supporting a loved one through a difficult time doesn't always mean financial assistance; it can also involve emotional support or help in finding professional resources. 

A new concise argument for the author being at fault is that the original poster is neglecting their familial responsibilities during a critical time. While self-care is essential, families often rely on one another during crises, and the original poster’s refusal to provide any form of support can deepen their mother’s struggles with addiction. By choosing to disengage completely, the poster is missing an opportunity to foster a healthier relationship and encourage their mother to seek the help she desperately needs. Instead of abandoning her, they could seek a balance that protects their well-being while still offering some form of support or guidance.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s crucial to understand that while protecting one’s mental health is essential, the original poster’s complete withdrawal from their mother’s life may exacerbate the very issues they are trying to escape. Addiction often thrives on isolation, and by stepping back entirely, the poster risks leaving their mother feeling abandoned, which could deepen her struggles. Emotional support, even without financial assistance, can play a vital role in encouraging someone to seek help.

A new concise argument for the author not being at fault is that the original poster is exercising necessary boundaries to safeguard their own well-being. They likely recognize that continued involvement in a toxic situation could lead to their own emotional burnout or mental health decline. By refusing to enable their mother’s behavior financially, they are promoting accountability and perhaps encouraging her to address her addiction more seriously. This decision reflects a mature understanding that sometimes, stepping back can be a catalyst for positive change, both for themselves and for their mother.","{'score': 3, 'criteria': 'The response shows some grounding but includes unsupported claims and lacks sufficient citation of factual support.', 'supporting_evidence': 'While the response discusses the importance of self-care and setting boundaries, it does not provide references to factual information or research regarding addiction and family dynamics, making some claims speculative.'}","- Winner: YTA

A reoccurring argument my mother and I have is that I don’t “hang out” with her as much as she’d like. Saying this, when we are both at home we don’t have issue being in one another’s space, walking our dogs together, cooking together or doing activities together (jigsaw puzzles, art etc) Today she asked me to join her and watch a local boat race and I declined. She then didn’t go because she didn’t want to go alone, and expressed frustration and an annoyance over my constant reluctance to hang out with her and now there is obvious tension between use. She makes me feel like I owe her more of my time. I’d understand if I lived out of home and we didn’t see each other every day, but I don’t believe I deserve to be guilt tripped into spending time with my mother, am I the asshole?",,"The OP is the asshole because while it’s understandable to want personal time, they fail to recognize their mother’s emotional needs and the importance of quality time in a parent-child relationship. By consistently declining invitations to engage in activities together, the OP is dismissing their mother’s desire for connection, which can lead to feelings of rejection and loneliness. A little effort to spend time together can strengthen their bond and improve family dynamics, especially since they live in the same household.

While I appreciate the concerns raised in the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the OP is not at fault for prioritizing their personal time and boundaries. Everyone has the right to manage their time and energy according to their own needs, and this does not inherently mean they are neglecting their familial responsibilities. 

Furthermore, it’s crucial to acknowledge that adult relationships, including those with parents, should be built on mutual respect and understanding. The OP's desire for personal space does not indicate a lack of love or care for their mother; rather, it is a necessary aspect of maintaining their own mental health and well-being. By establishing boundaries, the OP is modeling healthy behavior that can ultimately foster a more respectful and understanding relationship in the long run. 

In summary, the OP is not at fault because they are entitled to their personal time, and creating boundaries is essential for maintaining a healthy balance in any relationship.The OP is at fault because they are neglecting the emotional needs of their mother, who may be seeking connection and support. While personal time is important, dismissing repeated invitations from a parent can come across as ungrateful and hurtful. The OP’s refusal to engage undermines the potential for building a supportive and loving relationship, especially since they live in the same household. By making an effort to spend time with their mother, even if it feels inconvenient, the OP could foster a stronger bond and show appreciation for their parent’s role in their life. Balancing personal boundaries with familial responsibilities is crucial, and the OP’s current approach fails to recognize that.

While I understand the perspective that the OP might be neglecting their mother's emotional needs, it’s important to recognize that the OP is not at fault for prioritizing their personal time and mental health. Everyone has the right to set boundaries, and doing so is a healthy practice that can prevent feelings of resentment and burnout. 

Additionally, the OP's situation might involve factors such as work stress, personal commitments, or mental health considerations that make it difficult to engage in social activities. It’s essential to acknowledge that constantly feeling obligated to fulfill the emotional needs of others can be overwhelming, especially when one is trying to maintain their own well-being. The OP’s choice to decline invitations is a valid expression of self-care, and it does not reflect a lack of love or appreciation for their mother.

While I appreciate the concerns raised in the last YTA argument, it’s essential to highlight that the OP is not at fault for prioritizing their personal time and boundaries. Personal well-being is crucial, and everyone deserves the right to manage their time according to their needs without feeling guilty.

To further support this, it’s important to consider that healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and understanding. The OP's choice to decline invitations does not indicate a lack of love or appreciation for their mother; rather, it reflects a need for personal space that can ultimately lead to healthier dynamics. Engaging in activities out of obligation can breed resentment, while choosing to spend time when genuinely willing can create a more meaningful connection.

In summary, the OP's commitment to their own mental health and boundaries is a valid stance and an important aspect of fostering a balanced and respectful relationship with their mother.The OP is at fault because they are neglecting their mother's emotional needs and failing to recognize the significance of spending quality time together, especially since they live in the same household.

While I understand the concerns about the OP's relationship with their mother, it's important to clarify that the OP is not at fault for prioritizing their personal time and mental health. Everyone has the right to set boundaries, and doing so does not inherently mean they are neglecting their family.

In fact, the OP's choice to decline invitations can be seen as a form of self-care, which is crucial for maintaining a healthy mindset. By establishing boundaries, the OP is not only protecting their own well-being but also modeling healthy relationship dynamics. It's essential to recognize that relationships thrive on mutual respect, and the OP's need for personal space should be respected just as much as their mother's desire for connection.

Additionally, it’s possible that the OP has communicated their need for time alone. If that’s the case, the mother should understand and respect those boundaries rather than continuously pushing for engagement.

While personal time is vital, consistently turning down invitations can lead to feelings of rejection and isolation for the mother, who may be seeking companionship and support. The OP's repeated refusals demonstrate a lack of empathy and appreciation for their mother's efforts to bond, which can strain their relationship over time. A small investment of time and effort in connecting with their mother could go a long way in nurturing their relationship and showing care, making it essential for the OP to balance personal space with emotional support for their family.

While I see the concerns regarding the OP's relationship with their mother, it's crucial to emphasize that the OP is not at fault for prioritizing their personal time and mental health. Everyone has the right to set boundaries, and choosing to decline invitations does not equate to neglecting familial responsibilities. 

Moreover, the OP's need for personal space can actually benefit their relationship with their mother in the long run. By taking the time to recharge and maintain their own well-being, the OP can engage more genuinely when they do choose to spend time with their mother. This approach fosters a healthier dynamic where both parties can appreciate each other's presence without feeling burdened by obligation.

1oaavu1,AITA for wheeling my bin out after 11:00pm?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oaavu1/aita_for_wheeling_my_bin_out_after_1100pm/,NTA,YTA,False,"Our bins are collected on a Tuesday morning, so we usually put them out on a Monday evening. This is to avoid the hassle of putting them out in the morning or risk missing them being collected in case the binmen come early.   We forgot to put the bin out until I remembered at about 11pm. I brought our bin out and went back in. Bin got collected. Happy days.  My neighbour came up to me and got angry at me because I brought the bin out too late and that it was too noisy when they were trying to sleep. I apologised several times for this and told them that it won't happen again, but they just kept giving out about it and then walked back into their house without accepting it or even acknowledging it.  I went back inside, explained what happened to my fiancee. They think that:  1. They are being unreasonable telling us when we can and can't take our bin out. 2. That they were rude to walk away from me without acknowledging my apology. 3. That if they didn't want to hear outside noises that they shouldn't keep their bedroom windows open (they keep their bedroom window open every night)  I'll be more considerate about this going forward, either making sure to bring the bin out earlier or carrying the bin to the collection point so as to avoid the wheels making any noise, but them getting angry about it to me has taken me back a bit, and I feel like she doesn't like us anymore.  Just wondering what you guys think?",,"YTA because bringing your bin out at 11:00 PM, despite it being necessary for collection, shows a disregard for your neighbors' right to a peaceful environment during nighttime hours. Noise from wheeling a bin can be disruptive, especially late at night, and it would have been more considerate to wait until the morning or find a quieter method to do so. A little empathy for your neighbor's situation goes a long way in maintaining good relationships in a community.

While I understand the concern about noise and the desire for a peaceful environment, it's important to recognize that the original poster had a legitimate reason for taking their bin out at 11:00 PM. The timing of trash collection is often dictated by municipal schedules, and the poster was likely trying to adhere to those regulations. Additionally, many neighborhoods are accustomed to various noises at night, including late-night deliveries or maintenance work, which can make a single instance of wheeling out a bin less disruptive than suggested. 

New argument: The original poster was acting within their rights and responsibilities to ensure their waste was collected on time. It is unreasonable to expect someone to compromise their obligations for the sake of a neighbor’s comfort, especially when the action taken was both necessary and within the bounds of community guidelines. Therefore, the poster should not be faulted for prioritizing their duty as a resident.While I understand the concern about noise and the desire for a peaceful environment, it's important to recognize that the original poster had a legitimate reason for taking their bin out at 11:00 PM.

Additionally, many neighborhoods are accustomed to various noises at night, including late-night deliveries or maintenance work, which can make a single instance of wheeling out a bin less disruptive than suggested.

New argument: The original poster is at fault because they displayed a lack of consideration for their neighbor’s situation. Regardless of their obligation to put the bin out on time, the choice to do so late at night—when most people are winding down for sleep—demonstrates a disregard for the shared living environment. It would have been more respectful to wait until the morning or at least to take the bin out earlier in the evening. This lack of consideration for the comfort of others in the community is what ultimately makes the original poster in the wrong.

Additionally, many neighborhoods are accustomed to various noises at night, including late-night deliveries or maintenance work, which can make a single instance of wheeling out a bin less disruptive than suggested.

Refuting the last YTA argument: The assertion that the original poster showed a lack of consideration overlooks the fact that everyone has responsibilities, and adhering to waste collection schedules is crucial. It is unreasonable to expect residents to compromise their obligations for the sake of a neighbor’s comfort, particularly when the action taken was necessary and within community guidelines. 

New argument: The original poster acted responsibly by ensuring their waste was collected on time, which is a fundamental duty of being a good neighbor. It’s important to balance individual responsibilities with community expectations, and the poster's actions reflect a commitment to keeping the neighborhood clean. Therefore, they should not be faulted for managing their obligations, especially when such actions are necessary and time-sensitive.While I understand the concern about noise and the desire for a peaceful environment, it's important to recognize that the original poster had a legitimate reason for taking their bin out at 11:00 PM.

Additionally, many neighborhoods are accustomed to various noises at night, including late-night deliveries or maintenance work, which can make a single instance of wheeling out a bin less disruptive than suggested.

**Refuting the last NTA argument:** The argument that the poster was simply adhering to municipal schedules fails to acknowledge the importance of community consideration. While responsibilities are important, the timing of those responsibilities should also take into account the well-being of neighbors. Just because something is within the rules does not mean it is the most considerate choice.

**New argument:** The original poster is at fault because they displayed a lack of awareness regarding the impact of their actions on their neighbors. Taking out the bin at 11:00 PM, even if necessary, demonstrates a disregard for the shared living environment. It would have been more considerate to either take the bin out earlier in the evening or find a quieter way to do so. This lack of thoughtfulness for the comfort of others in the community is what ultimately makes the original poster in the wrong.

**New argument:** The original poster should not be considered at fault because they acted in accordance with the rules and expectations of their community. Responsible waste management is a civic duty that contributes to overall cleanliness and public health. By ensuring their trash was collected on time, the poster was fulfilling their obligation as a resident. It's important for neighbors to be understanding of each other's responsibilities, especially when those responsibilities are time-sensitive. Therefore, the poster's actions were justified and not deserving of blame.While I understand the concern about noise and the desire for a peaceful environment, it's important to recognize that the original poster had a legitimate reason for taking their bin out at 11:00 PM.

**Refuting the last YTA argument:** The argument that the original poster showed a lack of consideration overlooks the reality that everyone has obligations to fulfill. While it's essential to be mindful of neighbors, the poster was acting within their rights and responsibilities. Expecting someone to alter their necessary actions for the sake of another's convenience is unreasonable and sets a problematic precedent for community interactions.

**New argument:** The original poster is at fault because they failed to consider the potential disruption their actions could cause during late hours. Even though they were following the collection schedule, they could have chosen a more considerate time for this task or at least been more mindful of noise reduction. A little forethought can go a long way in maintaining harmonious relationships with neighbors, and this lack of consideration is what ultimately makes the original poster in the wrong.

**New argument:** The original poster is not at fault because they were fulfilling a necessary obligation to ensure their waste was collected on time. Community guidelines often dictate when trash must be put out, and by adhering to those regulations, the poster is actually contributing to the overall cleanliness and maintenance of the neighborhood.

His ex roommate has been dating this girl on&amp;off the past year or so. Ive had minimal interactions w her but everytime ive seen her in person she says nothing to me unless I say hi first then shell say hi. Shes told my bfs roommate from the get go that shes worried he wants to date me&amp;that im flirting w him. Both my bf&amp; his room mate know this isnt true. My bf and I have a really good relationship&amp; theres never been attraction or flirtation between me&amp;his room mate or any1 else for that matter  Room mates gf has messaged me several times on fb telling me she knows im attracted to her bf &amp; that I exclude her by not saying hi when I see her(shes referencing a time when she didnt hear me say hi&amp; found it rude). She doesnt believe me or my bf when we tell her im not attracted to her bf. She also asked me to stop talking to her bf &amp; i told her im not going to ignore him when im at my bfs house &amp; his rm-mate starts talking to both of us.   She even snooped so far back on my fb &amp; found a post I shared 10 or so years ago &amp; sent it to her bf w no context, asking him if he liked it&amp;when he said yeah she told him i had posted it(It wasnt even my original post, i just shared smthing). Her mssges&amp;stalking my fb were so anxiety inducing at one point I blocked her. She then found me on insta&amp;sent me a message telling me i was petty for blocking her,which I didnt even notice until she screen shot it, sent it to my bf&amp;then blocked him I unblocked her cause I felt bad and to explain why id blocked her in the first place Also she wont say a single thing to me in person &amp;ive invited her to hang w us several times but she never comes  Recently she &amp;her bf broke up. Its happened a couple times &amp; im not super close w my bfs rm-mate so I didnt think much of it until she sent me a message on fb telling me they broke up&amp; asking me if I could find him someone else to date. This is like within a week of them breaking up. I found this really weird and it made me even more anxious. I responded by telling her my bf, who was still living w him, could check on him&amp; left it at that  That brings us to the present. my bf moved in last week &amp; we invited his ex room mate over for this bon fire. I didnt think the gf would be a problem bc they arent 2gether but today he asked if she could come with. my bf &amp; I both said no. He said this made her sad &amp; he might not come  I really dont want her at my hosue. Shes made me so anxious &amp; it honestly makes me feel crazy that she even asked to come w after everything My bf is more chill abt her coming over but hes also supportive of me not wanting to see her  AITA? Should I let her come over? I feel bad that my bfs friend isnt gonna come now &amp; im worried shes gonna isolate him from his friends esp if hes living alone now",,"The original poster is in the wrong because they are allowing their personal anxieties and past interactions to dictate the social dynamics of the group. While it's understandable to feel uncomfortable, excluding someone from a social gathering based solely on past behavior and assumptions creates unnecessary division and reinforces a toxic atmosphere. The boyfriend’s friend deserves the chance to enjoy the bonfire with his girlfriend, and the original poster should strive to foster a more inclusive environment rather than letting their discomfort dictate the situation. It would be more mature to address any issues directly and openly rather than creating further tension and isolation.

While the last YTA argument emphasizes the need for inclusivity, it overlooks the importance of personal boundaries and the responsibility of individuals to protect their emotional well-being. The original poster is not at fault because they are prioritizing their comfort and mental health in a situation that has previously caused them distress. It's perfectly valid for someone to choose not to engage with individuals who have made them uncomfortable in the past, especially in a social setting where they should feel safe and at ease.

Additionally, the original poster's decision to communicate their concerns to their boyfriend shows a level of maturity and respect for their relationship. Rather than simply excluding the friend without explanation, they are advocating for their feelings and setting clear boundaries that are necessary for their own comfort. This proactive approach is crucial in maintaining healthy relationships, and it is unfair to expect them to compromise their mental well-being for the sake of group dynamics.The original poster is at fault because their actions reflect a lack of empathy and communication. While it's understandable to feel uncomfortable due to past experiences, it's important to recognize that personal anxieties should not dictate the social dynamics of a group. By choosing to exclude someone without attempting to address the situation directly, the original poster is fostering an environment of isolation rather than inclusivity. 

Moreover, the argument that the poster is protecting their emotional well-being overlooks the fact that open dialogue can lead to resolution and understanding. Instead of avoiding the friend entirely, the poster could have communicated their discomfort to their boyfriend, allowing him to facilitate a conversation between all parties involved. This would not only validate the poster's feelings but also provide an opportunity for the friend to explain their behavior and demonstrate growth. In this context, the original poster's decision to avoid the situation entirely is counterproductive and ultimately harmful to the group's cohesion.

The last YTA's argument focuses on the need for open communication and inclusivity, but it fails to acknowledge that the original poster has a right to prioritize their mental health and set boundaries. The original poster is not at fault because they are taking necessary steps to protect themselves from a potentially harmful situation. Past experiences can significantly impact how individuals feel in social settings, and it is valid for someone to choose not to engage with someone who has previously made them uncomfortable.

Furthermore, the original poster's decision to express their feelings to their boyfriend demonstrates an understanding of their own needs and a desire to maintain a healthy relationship. It is not unreasonable to want a safe space at social gatherings, especially when past interactions with this friend have caused anxiety. By choosing not to attend the bonfire, the original poster is making a proactive choice for their well-being, which should be respected rather than criticized. Ultimately, prioritizing one's mental health is not a fault; it is a responsible and self-aware decision.The original poster is at fault because their decision to exclude someone from a social gathering based on past interactions demonstrates a lack of willingness to engage in personal growth and conflict resolution. While it’s valid to feel uncomfortable, the poster's approach to handling that discomfort is overly reactive and discourages constructive dialogue. 

Instead of avoiding the situation entirely, the poster could have taken the opportunity to communicate their feelings to both their boyfriend and the friend in question. This would have allowed for a chance to address any misunderstandings and potentially foster an environment of healing and reconciliation. By opting out of the gathering rather than addressing their concerns directly, the original poster is not only limiting their own social experiences but also stifling the possibility of mending relationships within the group. This avoidance reinforces a cycle of discomfort rather than promoting understanding and resolution, ultimately making the poster's stance counterproductive and unfair.

The last YTA argument emphasizes the importance of open communication and engagement, but it overlooks the essential right individuals have to protect their mental well-being. The original poster is not at fault because they are making a conscious choice to prioritize their comfort in a situation that previously caused them distress. 

Setting boundaries is a crucial aspect of maintaining mental health, and the poster's decision to avoid a potentially uncomfortable encounter demonstrates self-awareness and self-care. It’s important to recognize that not everyone is obligated to endure situations that may trigger anxiety or discomfort, especially if they have had negative experiences in the past. By choosing not to attend, the original poster is taking a proactive step to ensure they feel safe and secure, which is a valid and responsible action. Rather than being criticized for their choice, they should be respected for prioritizing their emotional health in a social context.The original poster is at fault because their approach to the situation reflects a lack of empathy and an unwillingness to engage with the complexities of interpersonal relationships. While it’s valid to feel uncomfortable due to past experiences, choosing to exclude someone from a social gathering without attempting to address those feelings directly fosters division rather than resolution.

Instead of avoiding the friend, the poster could have used this as an opportunity to communicate their concerns to their boyfriend and even consider having an open dialogue with the friend. This would not only demonstrate maturity but also allow for the possibility of clearing the air and potentially mending any misunderstandings. By opting for avoidance, the original poster is not only missing an opportunity for personal growth but is also contributing to a toxic atmosphere that discourages communication and understanding among friends. Ultimately, fostering an inclusive environment requires effort from all parties, and the poster's decision to isolate themselves and the friend undermines that effort.

While the last YTA argument emphasizes the importance of open communication and engagement, it fails to recognize that the original poster is not at fault for prioritizing their own mental well-being in a challenging social scenario. The original poster’s decision to avoid the bonfire is a valid response to previous discomfort caused by the friend’s behavior. 

It’s crucial to acknowledge that individuals have the right to set personal boundaries for their emotional safety. In situations where past interactions have led to anxiety, it’s reasonable for the original poster to choose not to put themselves in a potentially triggering environment, especially if they have not yet had the chance to discuss their feelings with their boyfriend or the friend directly. By prioritizing their comfort, the original poster is exercising self-care, which is essential in maintaining healthy relationships. Rather than being faulted for this decision, they should be supported in their choice to ensure they feel safe and secure in social settings.The original poster is at fault because their decision to exclude someone from a social gathering based on past discomfort reflects a lack of willingness to engage constructively with their feelings and the people involved.

Instead of opting out of the bonfire, the original poster could have taken the opportunity to communicate their feelings to their boyfriend and the friend directly. This approach would not only validate their own feelings but also open the door for dialogue and healing. By creating an atmosphere of avoidance, the poster risks deepening divisions within the group and stifling the chance for personal growth and understanding. It’s essential to recognize that navigating social dynamics often requires confronting discomfort rather than retreating from it; thus, the poster’s decision ultimately undermines the potential for a more inclusive and supportive social environment.

1oa90yg,AITA for making my sick mom cook,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa90yg/aita_for_making_my_sick_mom_cook/,YTA,YTA,True,"My mom is upset with me for not wanting to help cook a dinner that I was invited to. I hate cooking, but my mom seems to think I need to help her cook.  Some details that matter: 1) the kitchen is tiny, and there are 4 people in there now 2) my step dad micro manages everything that happens in the kitchen 3) I was invited to eat dinner, not cook it 4) even though my mom is sick and says she cant stand for very long, she is one of the 4 people in the kitchen 5) I dont enjoy cooking  So AITA for making my sick mom cook?  Obviously I forgot some info, only 3 of the 4 are cooking, my step dad is micro managing, my mom is not contagious, she is just having some womanly issues that are causing cramping. My mom will not sit down, she has to be forced down, and there is only room in the kitchen for 2 people to cook comfortably. And I was holding the baby  I find myself commenting this a lot, so im going to put it up here... I would NEVER invite someone over for dinner and expect them to cook it. That is ridiculous. There is a difference between offering to help and being told to help. Also if my mom knew she was going to tell me to help, she should have said that when she invited me. I would have gladly helped if she had said ""the plan is to go pick up dinner stuff, make it together and then eat"" but when she made the plans she said ""we will go get dinner and spend some time together""",,"The original poster is at fault because, despite their dislike for cooking, it is unreasonable to expect a sick parent to take on all the responsibilities in the kitchen, especially when the family dynamic involves shared care and support. Instead of prioritizing their mother's well-being and helping out in a challenging situation, the original poster chose to focus on their discomfort rather than contributing to the family effort, which ultimately reflects a lack of empathy and support for their sick mom.

In response to the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster's dislike for cooking does not negate their responsibility to support a sick parent in a difficult time. While the expectation may be for everyone to contribute, the poster's decision to prioritize their own discomfort over their mother's needs can be seen as a lack of empathy.

New Argument: The original poster should not be at fault because they may have been overwhelmed by the situation and unable to provide the necessary help. It's crucial to consider that not everyone reacts to stress and illness in the same way; the pressures of a sick family member can lead to different coping mechanisms. Rather than being selfish, the original poster may have needed time to process the situation before feeling capable of stepping in, which underscores the importance of understanding individual circumstances rather than placing blame.In response to the last NTA argument, it is essential to recognize that while the original poster may have felt overwhelmed, their unwillingness to assist at a time when their mother was sick reflects a lack of basic familial responsibility. Illness in a family member often requires all hands on deck, and avoiding contributions because of personal discomfort is not a valid excuse. 

New Argument: The original poster is at fault because their actions demonstrate a lack of consideration for their mother's emotional and physical state. When a family member is unwell, it is not just about physical tasks like cooking; it's about providing support and showing care. By refusing to help, the original poster sent the message that their own feelings take precedence over their mother’s needs, which can be damaging to family relationships and shows a failure to prioritize their parent's well-being in a moment of vulnerability.

In response to the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster's discomfort with cooking does not excuse their failure to assist their sick mother. While everyone may cope differently, the expectation of family support during difficult times should be a priority, especially when a parent is unwell. The focus should be on the collective effort needed to care for a loved one, rather than individual preferences.

New Argument: The original poster should not be at fault because they may have been experiencing significant emotional stress themselves. Caring for a sick family member can be overwhelming, and the original poster's reluctance to cook could stem from feeling unprepared or anxious about the situation. Rather than being seen as selfish, their response could be a sign of needing support themselves. It's essential to consider that emotional well-being impacts one's ability to contribute, and their struggles do not diminish their love for their mother or their desire to help in other ways.In response to the last NTA argument, while emotional stress is a valid concern, it does not absolve the original poster from their responsibility to support a sick parent. Everyone experiences challenging situations, but family support is crucial during times of illness, and opting out of contributing simply because it is uncomfortable reflects poorly on the poster's commitment to family values.

New Argument: The original poster is at fault because they failed to communicate their feelings and seek alternative solutions. Instead of outright refusing to help, they could have explored other ways to support their mother, such as preparing simpler meals, ordering takeout, or working with family members to divide the responsibilities. By not taking initiative or collaborating, the original poster not only neglected their mother’s immediate needs but also missed an opportunity for open communication and teamwork within the family, which is vital during tough times.

In response to the last YTA argument, while it is true that family support is crucial during difficult times, it's important to acknowledge that not everyone is equipped to handle stress in the same way. The original poster's reluctance to cook may stem from a genuine feeling of being overwhelmed, which doesn't necessarily reflect a lack of commitment or care for their mother.

New Argument: The original poster should not be at fault because they may have been facing their own personal challenges that hindered their ability to help. It's essential to consider that the emotional weight of a parent’s illness can affect individuals differently. Rather than simply refusing to assist, the original poster might have been struggling with their own feelings of helplessness or anxiety, which can impact one's capacity to contribute effectively. Acknowledging their own limitations in that moment does not make them a bad child; rather, it highlights the complexity of family dynamics during crises, where support should be mutual and understanding should prevail.In response to the last NTA argument, while it's true that everyone copes with stress differently, the original poster's refusal to assist their sick mother reflects a lack of empathy and support that is typically expected in family dynamics. Taking care of a loved one, especially a parent, requires a level of commitment that transcends personal discomfort.

New Argument: The original poster is at fault because they failed to recognize that family responsibilities shift during times of illness. When a parent is unwell, it is not just about individual feelings or preferences; it’s about stepping up for the family unit as a whole. By choosing not to help, the original poster not only neglected their mother's immediate needs but also missed an opportunity to strengthen their family bond during a difficult time. This lack of willingness to contribute, even in a small way, demonstrates a disregard for the sacrifices that a sick parent often makes and undermines the fundamental principle of family support.

In response to the last YTA argument, while it's valid to emphasize the importance of family support, it's crucial to consider that not everyone reacts to stress and illness in the same manner. The original poster's reluctance to assist may stem from feeling overwhelmed or unprepared, rather than a lack of love or commitment to their mother.

New Argument: The original poster should not be at fault because they may have been dealing with their own emotional challenges that affected their ability to help. Caring for a sick parent can be a heavy emotional burden, and the original poster might have needed time to process the situation before feeling capable of contributing. Instead of viewing their response as selfish, it’s important to recognize that their emotional state could have genuinely hindered their ability to participate, highlighting the need for understanding and open communication within the family rather than assigning blame.In response to the last NTA argument, while it’s true that emotional challenges can affect one’s ability to help, the original poster’s failure to contribute during their mother’s illness indicates a lack of empathy and responsibility. Family dynamics often require individuals to step outside their comfort zones, especially when a parent is in need.

New Argument: The original poster is at fault because they demonstrated a lack of initiative in a time when their mother needed support the most. Rather than seeking alternative solutions or finding a way to contribute—even in a minimal capacity—they chose to prioritize their discomfort over their mother's well-being. This decision not only reflects a selfish attitude but also sets a concerning precedent about their willingness to support family members in times of crisis. When family members are unwell, it's essential to rally together, and the original poster's refusal to engage signifies a failure to uphold the values of compassion and cooperation that are vital in a family setting.

In response to the last YTA argument, while it’s important to recognize that family dynamics can be challenging, the original poster's decision to decline helping their sick mother demonstrates a lack of empathy and responsibility. Everyone experiences stress differently, but during times of illness, stepping up for a loved one is a fundamental expectation within family relationships.

New Argument: The original poster should not be at fault because their refusal to cook may stem from a legitimate need to set boundaries for their own mental health. If the original poster has had negative experiences or trauma related to cooking or caregiving, forcing themselves to engage in such activities could be detrimental to their well-being. It’s crucial to understand that individual mental health needs can impact one’s ability to provide support, and the original poster’s choice not to help could reflect a necessary self-care decision rather than outright selfishness. Instead of assigning blame, the focus could be on finding a balance that allows both the original poster and their mother to receive the support they need during this challenging time.","{'score': 3, 'criteria': 'The response contains some grounded arguments but includes unsupported claims and speculative statements.', 'supporting_evidence': 'The arguments made are based on assumptions about family dynamics and personal motivations, such as ""the original poster\'s discomfort with cooking does not excuse their failure to assist their sick mother"" and ""their unwillingness to assist at a time when their mother was sick reflects a lack of basic familial responsibility,"" which are not directly supported by the specific details given in the source.'}","- Winner: YTA

1oa9jv6,AITA I had my 21st birthday and some guy tried to break into my house,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa9jv6/aita_i_had_my_21st_birthday_and_some_guy_tried_to/,NTA,YTA,False,"So I turned 21 this week - my birthday was on the 15th and we hosted a party on the 18th. Th theme was 'dress as my favorite things' and I bought a karaoke machine for the party. I live in a student area where people are frequently hosting house parties, even then I made sure that our karaoke would not run past 11pm - as our council rules define quiet hours as between 11pm-7am. This was something I made sure that the loud parts of the party would stay between.  At about 8/9pm my friends started showing up we started doing our karaoke, at 10:05pm a neighbour I have never met before showed up at the door and was slamming on both the doorbell and the door, I opened the door thinking it was a friend. He then started screaming in my face about his babies not being able to sleep (he was 70/80) before I could apologise he tried to force his way into our house, stepping over our doormat - he only left when my boyfriend stepped in front of me. I know we were being loud, louder than parties normally in this area. we've handled our previous complaints with ease (the only ever other noise complaint I have had is for the flat above mine and I made the complainers banana bread to apologise).  We immediately turned off the music after he left - however I did end up having a panic attack from the way he yelled at me, and ended up calling 101 (the UK non emergency line) as I was shaken by the experience and that's what my mum said to do.   I now have a meeting with a police officer tomorrow, but don't know if I'm overacting or should have held the party at all?",,"The original poster is at fault for hosting a loud party in a residential area without considering the potential impact on their neighbors, especially those with young children. While they made efforts to comply with noise regulations, they failed to recognize that their celebration was disruptive enough to provoke an extreme reaction from a neighbor. By prioritizing their entertainment over community peace, they contributed to the situation that led to the confrontation, indicating a lack of consideration for others’ well-being.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it’s true that hosting a party in a residential area comes with a responsibility to be considerate of neighbors, the original poster made reasonable efforts to mitigate noise by setting a clear end time and informing neighbors in advance. It’s unreasonable to expect complete silence in a festive setting, especially when the poster attempted to balance their celebration with respect for those around them.

New concise argument: The original poster should not be at fault because they took proactive measures to communicate with their neighbors about the party, demonstrating a willingness to be considerate. Ultimately, the responsibility for managing personal reactions to social gatherings lies with individuals, and the neighbor’s extreme response reflects their inability to cope with typical neighborhood festivities rather than any fault on the part of the poster.The original poster is at fault for their inability to adequately gauge the impact of their party on the neighborhood, despite their efforts to communicate. While they may have notified neighbors and set a noise limit, they failed to recognize that the nature of their celebration would still significantly disrupt the peace, especially for families with young children. By prioritizing their own enjoyment without fully considering the community context, they inadvertently contributed to the escalating tensions, demonstrating a lack of empathy for their neighbors' circumstances.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the original poster did notify neighbors and set an end time for their party, it’s important to recognize that not all celebrations can be adequately contained. The expectation that a gathering will not disrupt anyone at all is unrealistic. The neighbor's extreme reaction indicates an intolerance for social events, which is not the responsibility of the party host.

New concise argument: The original poster should not be at fault because they took proactive steps to communicate with their neighbors and set boundaries for their party. Their efforts reflect a genuine consideration for the community, and the neighbor's reaction suggests an inability to handle typical neighborhood festivities. It’s unfair to place the burden of managing others’ discomfort solely on the host when they acted in good faith.The original poster is at fault for their failure to fully consider the potential consequences of their party on their neighbors, despite their attempts to inform them. While they did communicate plans and set an end time, they underestimated how a loud celebration would affect those living nearby, particularly families with young children who may have been trying to sleep. By prioritizing their own enjoyment over community harmony, they contributed to a situation that escalated tensions, indicating a lack of empathy for their neighbors' needs.

Refuting the last NTA argument: Although the original poster took some steps to inform their neighbors, simply notifying them does not absolve them of responsibility for the noise that ensued. Good neighbors consider the impact of their actions beyond just informing others—they actively strive to minimize disruption. The fact that a neighbor felt compelled to react strongly demonstrates that the party’s noise levels were unacceptable, suggesting that the poster's efforts were insufficient.

New concise argument: The original poster is at fault because they failed to adequately assess the potential impact of their loud party on the community. While they communicated their plans, they did not take the necessary steps to ensure that their celebration would not disturb others, particularly families with young children. This oversight reflects a lack of consideration for their neighbors' well-being, which is essential in a residential setting.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it’s true that the original poster informed their neighbors about the party, this does not excuse the disturbance caused. Simply notifying neighbors does not account for the level of noise generated, which can be disruptive regardless of prior warning. The expectation should be that a host takes full responsibility for managing noise levels during a celebration, especially in a residential area where families may have different schedules and needs.

New concise argument: The original poster should not be at fault because they made reasonable efforts to communicate their plans and intended to keep the noise to a minimum. Social gatherings are a normal part of community life, and while some noise is inevitable, the poster’s actions show a genuine attempt to be considerate. The neighbor's overreaction indicates a personal intolerance for such events rather than a fair assessment of the original poster's behavior.The original poster is at fault for not fully considering the impact their party would have on their neighbors, despite their efforts to inform them. While they did communicate their plans and set an end time, they underestimated the disruptive nature of a loud celebration, especially in a residential area where families may have young children who need to sleep. By prioritizing their own enjoyment without adequately managing the noise levels, they contributed to escalating tensions in the neighborhood.

Refuting the last NTA argument: Although the original poster made attempts to communicate their party plans, this does not absolve them of responsibility for the noise that ultimately disrupted their neighbors. Simply informing others does not address the core issue of maintaining a respectful environment. A responsible host should take proactive steps to ensure that their gathering does not exceed reasonable noise levels, especially when they know there are families nearby.

New concise argument: The original poster is at fault because they did not take sufficient measures to minimize noise during their party, despite their prior communication. Celebrating in a residential area requires a heightened awareness of how one’s actions affect the community. By failing to control the volume and allowing the party to escalate, they neglected their responsibility to foster a peaceful neighborhood atmosphere, ultimately leading to the conflict with their neighbor.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the original poster did communicate their party plans to their neighbors, this alone does not mitigate their responsibility for the noise generated during the celebration. Simply notifying others does not equate to actively ensuring that the event remains considerate of the community's peace. A responsible host must take additional steps to manage noise levels, especially in a residential area where neighbors may have different lifestyles and needs.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because they made a reasonable effort to inform their neighbors about the party and set an end time, demonstrating a genuine consideration for their community. Social gatherings are a normal part of neighborhood life, and while some noise is expected, the poster’s proactive communication indicates they were acting in good faith.

While communication is important, it does not excuse the disruption caused to those living nearby, particularly families with young children. A responsible host should have a clear understanding of the potential impact of their celebration and take concrete steps to ensure it remains respectful of the community's needs.

Refuting the last NTA argument: The assertion that the original poster is not at fault because they communicated their plans overlooks the fact that mere notification does not alleviate the responsibility to maintain a peaceful environment. It’s essential for hosts to actively monitor and control noise levels during their events. The fact that a neighbor felt compelled to react strongly indicates that the noise was excessive and disruptive, suggesting the original poster failed to fulfill their duty as a considerate neighbor.

New concise argument: The original poster is at fault because they did not take proactive measures to limit the noise generated by their party, despite being aware of the residential context. Good neighbors should not only inform others of a gathering but also actively ensure that their celebrations do not disturb others. By neglecting this responsibility, the poster contributed to a situation that escalated tensions, highlighting a lack of empathy for the diverse needs of their community.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it is true that the original poster informed their neighbors about the party, this does not absolve them of responsibility for the noise that occurred. Notification alone is insufficient if the party still resulted in significant disturbance. A host has an obligation to manage the noise levels effectively, particularly in a residential area where different households may have varying schedules and sensitivities to noise. The neighbor's extreme reaction indicates that the disruption was indeed excessive, suggesting that the poster failed to adequately control the situation.

New concise argument: The original poster should not be at fault because they made reasonable efforts to communicate their plans and set a designated end time for the party. They acted in good faith, attempting to be considerate of their neighbors.

1oa92qz,AITA for telling my roommate not to clean the apartment at night,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa92qz/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_not_to_clean_the/,NTA,YTA,False,"I'm living in an apartment with two roommates, so we're three total. Each of us have their own room and we share a kitchen and a bathroom. One of my roommates came back from studying abroad for a year, so he is still often rearranging stuff in the apartment. I probably should mention that the roommate in question is neurodivergent with ADHD, so it is difficult for him to follow a regular schedule.   I sleep very lightly and react very negatively to noise while trying to sleep. Also I really value going to sleep ""early"" (earlier than my roommates that is, anything from 11pm-1am is usual for me) and getting at least eight hours of it. Because of this I've already had discussions with my roommates a few times, because they either don't mind noise or go to sleep very late. I've told them multiple times that it bothers me if they're being noisy at night.  So in this instance I was trying to sleep at 22:45 when I hear my roommate being really loud in the hallway, rearranging stuff and turning on the vacuum cleaner which woke me up instantly. I waited for a few minutes, but when I realized it would be a longer thing I went out of my room to confront him about it. I tried to ask nicely if he could try being more quiet and told him that I don't think it's okay to vaccume this late in the day because I want to sleep and it might bother the neighbours. He responded that he will try to be more quiet but also that he will continue vacuuming at some point this night. He told me that this is the only time he has the chance to do it and he really wants to clean the place. He insisted that his interest in cleaning up the place is just as legit as my interest in sleeping, so I should try to be more sympathetic to him.  We discussed it some more and eventually he did concede to do me a favour, but still thinks he's in the right. In the end I felt quite bad about it and wonder if I am ta for stopping my roommates from doing things that are important to them because of me wanting to go to sleep at a reasonable time.  Edit: for anyone interested, he still makes noise at night, vacuuming, assembling his furniture and so on even though I told him I'm not okay with it. He just doesn't ask me anymore.",,"The original poster is the asshole because they are not considering the needs and challenges of their neurodivergent roommate. While their desire for a quiet environment to sleep is understandable, the roommate's ADHD may make it difficult for them to adhere to a conventional schedule. Instead of fostering understanding and compromise, the original poster is imposing rigid boundaries that disregard their roommate's legitimate need to clean and organize, particularly upon returning from an extended absence. A more empathetic approach would involve finding a mutually agreeable time for cleaning that accommodates both parties, rather than outright dismissing the roommate's needs at night.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s important to recognize that the original poster is not dismissing their roommate’s needs, but rather setting necessary boundaries for their well-being. The roommate’s neurodivergence does not negate the original poster’s right to a peaceful living environment, especially when it comes to sleep. It's essential to balance both individuals' needs, and the original poster’s request for quiet during nighttime hours is a reasonable expectation in any shared living situation.

Moreover, a new argument for why the original poster is not at fault is that they communicated their boundaries in advance, establishing clear expectations for their living arrangement. This proactive communication demonstrates respect for their roommate’s needs while also asserting their own. By doing so, the original poster has shown consideration and responsibility in maintaining a harmonious household, rather than being unreasonable or dismissive.The original poster is at fault because they failed to engage in a constructive dialogue with their roommate about the cleaning schedule. While it’s true that the original poster has a right to a quiet environment for sleep, they neglected to consider the roommate's perspective and the challenges posed by ADHD. Instead of approaching the situation collaboratively, the original poster set a hard boundary without discussing potential compromises, which could have included agreeing on specific cleaning times that work for both parties. This lack of communication and willingness to accommodate each other’s needs creates unnecessary tension in the living situation, making the original poster responsible for the conflict. 

Moreover, the original poster's approach could easily be perceived as inflexible and dismissive, which can exacerbate feelings of frustration or inadequacy in a neurodivergent individual. In shared living spaces, it’s crucial to maintain open lines of communication and foster an environment of mutual respect and understanding. By not doing so, the original poster demonstrates a lack of empathy and accountability for the dynamics of their shared home.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's essential to acknowledge that the original poster is not at fault for asserting their needs for a quiet environment. While the roommate's neurodivergence is a valid consideration, the original poster’s request for peace during sleeping hours is a fundamental right in any shared living situation. Setting boundaries is crucial for maintaining personal well-being, and the original poster has the right to protect their rest without being labeled inconsiderate.

Additionally, a new argument in favor of the original poster is that they have made an effort to communicate their needs clearly. By expressing their need for quiet at night, the original poster is not only advocating for themselves but also encouraging a healthier living dynamic. This proactive communication is necessary in any shared space, and it demonstrates respect for both parties.

While it's understandable that they need a quiet environment for sleep, disregarding their roommate's needs and not engaging in a collaborative discussion about cleaning times demonstrates a lack of empathy. Instead of addressing the issue together, the original poster set a hard boundary that left no room for negotiation or understanding of the roommate's perspective, especially considering their ADHD.

Moreover, the original poster's rigid stance can create a hostile living environment, as it implies that their needs are more important than their roommate's. A more considerate approach would have involved discussing a cleaning schedule that accommodates both their need for sleep and the roommate's need for a clean space. By not fostering this dialogue, the original poster is contributing to the conflict rather than working toward a solution, which ultimately makes them at fault in this situation.

The original poster is not at fault because they have a right to establish boundaries for their personal well-being, particularly concerning their sleep needs. While the roommate's ADHD is a valid consideration, it does not negate the original poster's need for a quiet environment during nighttime hours. Setting boundaries is essential in shared living situations, and the original poster communicated their needs clearly and respectfully.

Additionally, the original poster's request for quiet is reasonable and reflects a common expectation in shared living arrangements. They are not being unreasonable; rather, they are ensuring that their basic needs are met. The onus is on both roommates to find a compromise that respects each other's needs. The original poster is advocating for their right to a peaceful living space, which is entirely justified. Therefore, they should not be blamed for asserting their boundaries in an effort to maintain their well-being.The original poster is at fault because they displayed a lack of empathy and flexibility in their approach to their roommate's needs. While it's valid to seek a quiet environment for sleep, the original poster could have engaged in a more constructive dialogue to find a solution that accommodates both their need for rest and the roommate's need to clean. Instead of dismissing their roommate's actions as inconsiderate, they could have suggested alternative cleaning times or even participated in the process to ensure it didn't interfere with their sleep.

By failing to foster a collaborative atmosphere, the original poster contributes to an environment of tension and misunderstanding. Living with someone requires compromise and an understanding of each other's unique challenges. The original poster's rigid stance creates unnecessary conflict rather than promoting a harmonious living situation, making them responsible for the friction in their shared home.

The original poster is not at fault because they are exercising their right to set boundaries for their personal space and well-being, particularly regarding their need for quiet during nighttime hours. While the roommate's ADHD is a valid consideration, it does not absolve the roommate from respecting the original poster's need for a peaceful environment, especially when sleep is essential for overall health.

Additionally, the original poster could have taken the initiative to propose a specific time for cleaning that would work for both them and their roommate.

I have explained to them that I’m not much of a texter or caller but they still think as friends we should be calling/texting everyday. I feel as if it is childish for them to expect that. I feel like those are more relationship standards than they are friendship standards. AITA?,,"YTA because friendship requires mutual effort and communication, and your friends are expressing a desire for connection beyond just work hours. While everyone has different styles of maintaining friendships, dismissing their feelings as childish shows a lack of consideration for their needs. Real friendships thrive on nurturing, which often includes reaching out regularly, even if it's just a quick text or call. By not making an effort to engage with them outside of work, you risk undermining the relationship and making them feel undervalued as friends.

In response to the YTA argument, the original poster's approach to friendship should not be viewed as a fault but rather as a reflection of their personal boundaries and communication style. It's important to recognize that not everyone has the same capacity or desire to maintain relationships outside of work. The poster may prioritize their time differently, and this doesn't inherently diminish their value as a friend. 

Furthermore, friendships should be built on mutual respect for each other's preferences and boundaries. If the friends are feeling neglected, it’s crucial for them to communicate this directly rather than placing the blame solely on the poster. A healthy friendship allows for individual differences in how connections are maintained, and the poster is not at fault for adhering to their own comfort levels.YTA because your friends are expressing a genuine desire for connection, and dismissing their feelings as childish is not only disrespectful but also demonstrates a lack of empathy. While you may have different priorities or ways of maintaining friendships, it's essential to recognize that friendship is a two-way street.

Friends should support each other’s needs, and by failing to do so, you risk alienating those who genuinely care about you.

Not everyone feels comfortable or inclined to engage outside of work, and that should be respected. 

Moreover, friendships thrive on mutual understanding and respect for each other's boundaries. If the friends are feeling neglected, it would benefit them to communicate their feelings directly rather than blaming the poster. Effective communication is key in any relationship, and it’s unfair to place the entire burden of maintaining the friendship on one person. The poster's choice to prioritize their time differently does not make them a bad friend; it merely reflects their personal boundaries and comfort level in social interactions.YTA because your friends are reaching out to maintain a connection, and dismissing their feelings as childish is disrespectful.

A small effort to reach out or reciprocate their invitations could significantly strengthen your friendships and show that you value them. Remember, relationships are built on understanding and effort from both sides; dismissing their feelings only creates distance and misunderstanding.

In response to the YTA argument, it’s important to acknowledge that the original poster is not at fault for their approach to friendships; rather, they may simply have a different perspective on maintaining relationships. Not everyone feels comfortable or inclined to engage outside of work, and that choice should be respected.

Additionally, friendships should be built on mutual understanding. If the friends are feeling neglected, it's their responsibility to communicate this directly rather than placing the blame solely on the poster. Healthy relationships thrive on open dialogue, and it's unfair to expect one person to bear the entire burden of maintaining the friendship. The poster's preference for a different style of connection doesn't invalidate their friendships; rather, it reflects their individual boundaries and comfort levels. Ultimately, both parties should work towards understanding each other's needs without assigning blame.YTA because your friends are actively trying to build a connection with you outside of work, and dismissing their feelings as childish shows a lack of respect for their needs. Friendships are built on mutual effort and emotional support, and by not engaging with them outside of work, you’re signaling that you don’t value the relationship as much as they do. 

While it’s true that everyone has different priorities, a healthy friendship requires some level of reciprocation. Ignoring their attempts to reach out can lead to feelings of neglect and resentment. By not making an effort to connect, you risk alienating those who genuinely care about you. A little outreach on your part could go a long way in strengthening these friendships and demonstrating that you appreciate their efforts. Remember, relationships thrive on understanding and communication, and it’s important to acknowledge and respond to the emotions of those who care about you.

In response to the YTA argument, it's important to emphasize that the original poster is not at fault for their approach to friendships; rather, they may simply have a different perspective on how to maintain relationships. Everyone has different capacities for social interaction and emotional engagement, and it’s perfectly valid for the poster to prioritize their time and energy in a way that feels comfortable for them.

Moreover, friendships should be based on mutual respect and understanding. If the friends feel neglected, it is their responsibility to communicate those feelings directly instead of attributing blame solely to the poster. A healthy friendship allows for differences in how connections are nurtured. The poster’s choice to engage in a manner that aligns with their personal boundaries does not diminish their value as a friend; it reflects an individual approach to social relationships. Ultimately, both parties should strive for open communication and understanding rather than assigning blame, allowing for healthier dynamics in the friendship.","{'score': 3, 'criteria': 'The response demonstrates some grounding but contains a mix of supported claims and speculative statements.', 'supporting_evidence': ""While it accurately discusses the importance of communication and effort in friendships, it also presents subjective views on the necessity of those efforts, stating that 'A little outreach on your part could go a long way' and 'your choice to prioritize your time differently does not make you a bad friend,' which are less factual and more speculative.""}","- Winner: YTA
