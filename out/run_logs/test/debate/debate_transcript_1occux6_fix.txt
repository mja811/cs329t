--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: So I'm friends with this guy that I've known
since kindergarten. He got married some years ago and now him and his wife have
a little baby girl and she's currently at toddler age. I come over often enough
that I'm used to seeing the little bugger and she's great. I don't have any
other little kids from family or anything in my life so it's been great seeing a
little human grow.   Every once in a blue moon they ask me to watch her for a
few hours while my friend and his wife get some date time or whatver they need
to do. So I was hanging out with her and I know that they've been trying to get
her to take her first steps. I read about a trick where if you make them hold
something then they will walk without holding onto a surface. So I gave her a
toy and filmed it and it worked!   I sent the video to them and my friend didn't
care, he was just happy but his wife was pissed! She was mad at me that they
weren't there for that big moment. I don't have the type of relationsbio with
her where I can have a deep 1 on 1 with her but I talked to my friend about it
and he's not upset with me but his wife still is. She thinks I robbed her if a
key moment. I did het it on film but I get what she's saying.   I had no
malicious intent but was I the AH for getting the toddler to take those first
steps? I hi estoy didn't think the trick would work but it did.

YTA: The author of the post is an asshole because, despite having good
intentions, they disregarded the emotional significance of a child's first steps
for the parents. This moment is a milestone that should be shared with both
parents, and by facilitating it without their presence, the author undermined
the parents' experience and robbed them of a cherished memory. Even if the
intention was to help, the author should have communicated with the parents
before attempting to orchestrate such a significant moment.

NTA: Refuting YTA's argument: While it's true that the first steps of a child
are a significant milestone for parents, the author of the post did not intend
to undermine this moment but rather to create a supportive environment for the
child and their family. The author acted out of kindness, trying to help the
parents by encouraging the child in a way that could foster development. Many
people can relate to situations where they want to help but may not fully
understand the emotional weight of specific moments. In similar circumstances,
commenters noted that sometimes, good intentions can lead to misunderstandings,
and it's crucial to recognize the underlying effort to support others rather
than label them as inconsiderate (see example comment #4).  New concise
argument: The author’s actions stem from a place of care and support rather than
malice. Their intention was to encourage the child's growth and confidence, as
noted in example comment #7, which emphasizes that fostering a child’s
development is a collaborative effort, and sometimes well-meaning actions may
not align with everyone’s expectations. Thus, the author's approach should be
viewed in the context of their positive intentions, rather than as a disregard
for the parents' feelings.

because they completely disregarded the parents' feelings and the significance
of a child's first steps. This moment is meant to be shared with the parents,
and by facilitating it without their presence, the author not only overshadowed
this milestone but also robbed the parents of a cherished memory. Even with good
intentions, the author should have considered how their actions would impact the
family dynamic.  NTA says: Refuting YTA's argument: While the author may have
unintentionally overshadowed a significant moment, their actions were motivated
by a desire to support the child and the family. The author likely believed they
were helping the child develop and grow, which speaks to their positive
intentions. In similar situations, commenters have pointed out that the desire
to support others can sometimes lead to misinterpretations of emotional
significance (see example comment #3).  New concise argument: The author is an
asshole because they failed to communicate with the parents about their
intentions, leading to a breach of trust and a lack of respect for the parents'
role in their child's life. As noted in example comment #5, meaningful
milestones should involve the parents, and by not including them, the author
undermined the very foundation of family support and shared experiences.

NTA: Refuting YTA's argument: While YTA asserts that the author is an asshole
for overshadowing the parents' experience, it's essential to recognize that the
author acted from a place of support and encouragement for the child's
development. The author likely believed they were providing a nurturing
environment, which is a common motivation when adults engage with children. In
cases like this, commenters have noted that intentions matter, and sometimes the
desire to help can lead to unintentional missteps (see example comment #4).
New concise argument: The author's actions, while perhaps misguided in
execution, were rooted in a genuine desire to foster the child's confidence and
growth. As highlighted in example comment #6, it’s important to acknowledge that
the journey of development often includes supportive figures beyond the parents.
The author’s involvement, rather than being a malicious act, reflects a broader
community approach to nurturing a child, which should be celebrated rather than
condemned.

perceived slights (see example comment #3).  New concise argument: However, the
author is an asshole because they prioritized their own desire to be involved
over the parents’ right to witness their child's milestone. The act of
facilitating the first steps without the parents present demonstrates a lack of
respect for their emotional investment in the moment. As pointed out in example
comment #5, meaningful milestones should be shared with parents, and by
excluding them, the author undermined the family bond and the significance of
the event.

they were fostering growth, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings about
emotional significance.  New concise argument: The author is not an asshole
because their actions stemmed from a place of care and support, not malice. As
noted in example comment #6, it’s important to recognize that caregiving and
support can come from various figures in a child's life, and the intention to
help a child grow should be acknowledged. By trying to encourage the child's
first steps, the author was contributing to the child's development, which is a
positive act, even if it wasn't executed perfectly. This perspective highlights
the collaborative nature of parenting and child-rearing, where multiple adults
can play supportive roles in a child's milestones.

author is indeed an asshole because they prioritized their own desire to be

it upon themselves to orchestrate such a significant moment without the parents
present, the author disrespected the family's experience and created a situation
that could lead to resentment. As pointed out in example comment #5, meaningful
milestones should be shared with parents, and excluding them undermines the
importance of family bonds. The author’s actions reflect a lack of consideration
for the parents’ feelings, making them the asshole in this situation.

NTA: NTA says: Refuting YTA's argument: The assertion that the author is an
asshole for overshadowing the parents' experience overlooks the author's
intentions. The author aimed to encourage and support the child's development,
which is a positive and caring action. Many commenters have noted that in
situations involving children, well-meaning intentions can sometimes lead to
misunderstandings, but this does not make someone an asshole (see example
comment #3).  New concise argument: The author is not an asshole because their
actions were driven by a desire to help rather than to diminish the parents'
role. As highlighted in example comment #8, supporting a child's growth often
involves various adults in their life, and the author's encouragement could be
seen as contributing to that supportive network. Rather than focusing solely on
the parents' perspective, it's important to recognize the collaborative nature
of raising children, where shared moments of growth can involve family and
friends alike. The author’s intention to foster the child’s confidence should be
acknowledged as a positive contribution to the child’s development.

the first steps are indeed significant for parents, the author acted with good

shouldn't automatically label someone as an asshole. Many commenters have

those trying to do good can inadvertently create misunderstandings (see example
comment #4).  New concise argument: However, the author is an asshole because
they failed to respect the parents' emotional investment in their child's
milestones. By orchestrating the child's first steps without the parents'
knowledge or involvement, the author not only undermined the parents' experience
but also created a situation where they felt excluded from a pivotal moment in
their child's life. As noted in example comment #5, significant milestones
should be shared with parents, and the author’s disregard for this fundamental
aspect of parenting demonstrates a lack of empathy and consideration for the
family dynamic, making them an asshole in this situation.

Their intention was to foster the child's development, which is a positive
action rather than an attempt to overshadow the parents. Many commenters have
pointed out that good intentions can sometimes lead to misunderstandings, and
this doesn't inherently make someone an asshole (see example comment #3).  New
concise argument: The author is not an asshole because their actions were
motivated by a desire to help and support the child, reflecting a community-
oriented approach to parenting. As noted in example comment #6, involving
multiple caring figures in a child's life can be beneficial for their growth.
The author’s encouragement may have been well-meaning, and while communication
could have improved the situation, their intent to contribute positively to the
child's development should be acknowledged rather than condemned.

Moderator Summary: **Summary of Arguments:**  **YTA (You're The Asshole):**
The author is criticized for disregarding the parents' feelings and the
emotional significance of their child's first steps. This milestone is meant to
be shared with both parents, and by facilitating it without their presence, the
author overshadowed the moment and robbed the parents of a cherished memory.
Even with good intentions, the author should have communicated with the parents
first to respect their role in this significant event.  **NTA (Not The
Asshole):**   The author acted out of good intentions, aiming to support the
child's development rather than overshadow the parents. Their desire to help is
seen as a positive action, and many commenters emphasize that intentions matter.
While the author may have unintentionally created a misunderstanding, their
motivation to encourage the child's growth should be acknowledged. The
collaborative nature of parenting allows for multiple figures to support a
child's milestones, and the author's actions can be viewed as part of that
supportive network.  **Determination of Winner:**   The arguments presented by
YTA emphasize the emotional significance of parental involvement in milestones,
which is a valid point. However, NTA provides a strong counterpoint by
highlighting the author's intentions and the potential for misunderstandings in
such situations. The emphasis on the collaborative nature of child-rearing and
the recognition of good intentions suggests that while the author's actions
could have been better communicated, they were not malicious.  **Final
Decision:**   Winner: NTA (30%)    **Explanation of Score:**   The score
reflects a recognition that while the author could have handled the situation
better by communicating with the parents, their intentions were not to undermine
the parents' experience. The emotional weight of the moment is significant, and
the author bears some responsibility for not considering this, hence the 30%
fault. Factors that lowered the score include the author's genuine desire to
support the child's development and the acknowledgment that misunderstandings
can occur when intentions are misaligned with expectations.
