--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: So I'm friends with this guy that I've known
since kindergarten. He got married some years ago and now him and his wife have
a little baby girl and she's currently at toddler age. I come over often enough
that I'm used to seeing the little bugger and she's great. I don't have any
other little kids from family or anything in my life so it's been great seeing a
little human grow.   Every once in a blue moon they ask me to watch her for a
few hours while my friend and his wife get some date time or whatver they need
to do. So I was hanging out with her and I know that they've been trying to get
her to take her first steps. I read about a trick where if you make them hold
something then they will walk without holding onto a surface. So I gave her a
toy and filmed it and it worked!   I sent the video to them and my friend didn't
care, he was just happy but his wife was pissed! She was mad at me that they
weren't there for that big moment. I don't have the type of relationsbio with
her where I can have a deep 1 on 1 with her but I talked to my friend about it
and he's not upset with me but his wife still is. She thinks I robbed her if a
key moment. I did het it on film but I get what she's saying.   I had no
malicious intent but was I the AH for getting the toddler to take those first
steps? I hi estoy didn't think the trick would work but it did.
