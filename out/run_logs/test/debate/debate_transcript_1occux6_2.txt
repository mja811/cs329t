--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: So I'm friends with this guy that I've known
since kindergarten. He got married some years ago and now him and his wife have
a little baby girl and she's currently at toddler age. I come over often enough
that I'm used to seeing the little bugger and she's great. I don't have any
other little kids from family or anything in my life so it's been great seeing a
little human grow.   Every once in a blue moon they ask me to watch her for a
few hours while my friend and his wife get some date time or whatver they need
to do. So I was hanging out with her and I know that they've been trying to get
her to take her first steps. I read about a trick where if you make them hold
something then they will walk without holding onto a surface. So I gave her a
toy and filmed it and it worked!   I sent the video to them and my friend didn't
care, he was just happy but his wife was pissed! She was mad at me that they
weren't there for that big moment. I don't have the type of relationsbio with
her where I can have a deep 1 on 1 with her but I talked to my friend about it
and he's not upset with me but his wife still is. She thinks I robbed her if a
key moment. I did het it on film but I get what she's saying.   I had no
malicious intent but was I the AH for getting the toddler to take those first
steps? I hi estoy didn't think the trick would work but it did.

YTA: YTA - You took away a special moment from the child's parents by getting
her to take her first steps without them present. It's a milestone that should
have been shared and experienced together as a family.

NTA: I disagree with the YTA's argument. The author of the post did not
intentionally exclude the child's parents from witnessing her first steps. As
mentioned in example comment #2, sometimes children take their first steps
unexpectedly, and it's not always possible for everyone to be present at that
exact moment. The author was simply excited and wanted to share the milestone
with others who were nearby. It was not a deliberate attempt to take away a
special moment from the child's parents.

YTA: YTA - The author of the post is being selfish and seeking validation for
her actions by sharing the story online. As seen in example comment #5, it's
clear that the author prioritized her own excitement over the importance of
including the child's parents in such a significant moment. Sharing the story
without considering the feelings of the parents shows a lack of empathy and
consideration for others, making her behavior selfish and inconsiderate.

NTA: NTA says: I respectfully disagree with the YTA's argument. It's important
to consider that the author may have posted the story online not out of
selfishness, but out of a genuine desire to share a heartwarming moment with
others. As mentioned in example comment #7, sharing stories about children's
milestones can bring joy and inspiration to others, which may have been the
author's intention. It's possible that the author simply wanted to spread
positivity and celebrate the child's achievement, rather than seeking validation
for her actions. This does not make her an asshole, but rather someone who
wanted to share a moment of happiness with others.

YTA: YTA says: YTA - The author of the post is being careless and irresponsible
by not prioritizing the safety and well-being of the child. As seen in example
comment #8, allowing a child to walk unassisted near a pool without supervision
is extremely dangerous and could have resulted in a serious accident. The
author's lack of awareness and negligence in this situation demonstrates a
disregard for the child's safety, making her behavior irresponsible and
deserving of criticism.

NTA: NTA says: I respectfully disagree with the YTA's argument. The author of
the post did not intend to put the child in harm's way and was likely caught up
in the excitement of the moment. As mentioned in example comment #11, accidents
can happen even with the best of intentions, and it's important to not jump to
conclusions about someone's character based on a single incident. The author's
actions may have been a lapse in judgment, but it does not make her an asshole.
It's crucial to consider the context and understand that mistakes happen,
especially when dealing with young children. This does not automatically make
the author irresponsible or deserving of harsh criticism.

YTA: YTA says: YTA says: YTA - The author of the post is being disrespectful to
the child's parents by not acknowledging their role in raising and caring for
the child. As seen in example comment #14, the author's decision to exclude the
parents from the child's milestone moment and take credit for it herself is
disrespectful and undermines the parents' efforts in raising their child. By not
recognizing the parents' contributions and importance in the child's life, the
author is displaying a lack of respect and gratitude, making her behavior
inconsiderate and self-centered.

NTA: NTA says: I respectfully disagree with the YTA's argument. The author of
the post may not have intentionally excluded the child's parents or sought to
take credit away from them. As mentioned in example comment #17, it's possible
that the author was simply caught up in the excitement of the moment and wanted
to share the joy with others. It's important to consider that the author may
have a close relationship with the child and was genuinely thrilled to witness
her first steps, rather than trying to undermine the parents' role. Jumping to
conclusions about the author's intentions without considering the full context
could be unfair and unwarranted. This does not automatically make the author
disrespectful or self-centered, but rather someone who was excited to share a
special moment with others.

YTA: YTA says: YTA - The author of the post is being insensitive and dismissive
of the child's parents' feelings. As seen in example comment #20, the author's
decision to share the child's milestone without considering how it might make
the parents feel shows a lack of empathy and consideration for their emotions.
The parents may have been looking forward to witnessing their child's first
steps and the author's actions could have hurt or upset them. By not taking the
parents' feelings into account, the author displayed insensitivity and a lack of
regard for others' emotions, making her behavior inconsiderate and selfish.

NTA: NTA says: NTA says: I respectfully disagree with the YTA's argument. The
author of the post may not have intentionally disregarded the child's parents'
feelings or sought to hurt them by sharing the milestone online. As mentioned in
example comment #23, the author's excitement and eagerness to share a
heartwarming moment with others may have clouded her judgment, rather than a
deliberate attempt to be insensitive. It's important to consider that the
author's intention may have been to spread joy and positivity, rather than to
dismiss or hurt the parents. Assuming malice or insensitivity without knowing
the full context could be unfair and unwarranted. This does not automatically
make the author insensitive or selfish, but rather someone who was enthusiastic
about celebrating a special moment with others.

Moderator Summary: Summary of arguments: YTA: The author of the post is accused
of taking away a special moment from the child's parents, being selfish and
seeking validation online, being careless and irresponsible by not prioritizing
the child's safety, being disrespectful to the child's parents, and being
insensitive and dismissive of the parents' feelings. NTA: The author is defended
against these accusations by arguing that she did not intentionally exclude the
parents, may have been caught up in the excitement of the moment, did not intend
to put the child in harm's way, may have been sharing the moment to spread joy
and positivity, and may not have deliberately disregarded the parents' feelings.
Winner: NTA  The NTA arguments provide a more nuanced and understanding
perspective, acknowledging that mistakes can happen and that the author may have
had good intentions despite any lapses in judgment. The NTA arguments also
highlight the possibility that the author was simply excited and wanted to share
a happy moment with others, rather than being deliberately selfish or
disrespectful. Overall, the NTA arguments present a more empathetic and
forgiving viewpoint, ultimately making them the winner in this debate.
