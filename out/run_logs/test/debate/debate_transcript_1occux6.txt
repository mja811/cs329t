--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: So I'm friends with this guy that I've known
since kindergarten. He got married some years ago and now him and his wife have
a little baby girl and she's currently at toddler age. I come over often enough
that I'm used to seeing the little bugger and she's great. I don't have any
other little kids from family or anything in my life so it's been great seeing a
little human grow. Every once in a blue moon they ask me to watch her for a
few hours while my friend and his wife get some date time or whatver they need
to do. So I was hanging out with her and I know that they've been trying to get
her to take her first steps. I read about a trick where if you make them hold
something then they will walk without holding onto a surface. So I gave her a
toy and filmed it and it worked!I sent the video to them and my friend didn't
care, he was just happy but his wife was pissed! She was mad at me that they
weren't there for that big moment. I don't have the type of relationsbio with
her where I can have a deep 1 on 1 with her but I talked to my friend about it
and he's not upset with me but his wife still is. She thinks I robbed her if a
key moment. I did het it on film but I get what she's saying. I had no
malicious intent but was I the AH for getting the toddler to take those first
steps? I hi estoy didn't think the trick would work but it did.

YTA: The author is an asshole because they disregarded the significance of a
major milestone for the child's parents by prioritizing their own excitement
over the parents' emotional experience. First steps are a cherished moment for
parents, and by facilitating the event without them present, the author
undermined their role and created unnecessary conflict. Even with good
intentions, the author should have respected the parents' desire to witness such
a pivotal moment in their child's development.

NTA: In response to the YTA argument, it's essential to recognize that the
author likely acted out of a desire to celebrate the child's achievements rather
than to undermine the parents' experience. The author's intention may have been
to create a joyful moment that everyone could share, demonstrating their support
and love for the family. Emotional moments can be complex, and sometimes, in an
effort to celebrate, people may inadvertently overlook others' feelings.
However, this does not inherently make the author an asshole; rather, it shows
that they are human and capable of misjudgment in a well-meaning context.
Additionally, a new argument for why the author is not an asshole is that they
may have genuinely believed that sharing the child's first steps would bring joy
to everyone involved, including the parents. If the author had a history of
being supportive and involved in the child's life, it suggests they were acting
out of a place of love and enthusiasm, rather than malice. Their actions can be
seen as an attempt to foster a sense of community and celebration, which is not
inherently selfish or disrespectful.

with good intentions, the author should have respected the parents' desire to
witness such a pivotal moment in their child's development. Refuting the NTA
argument: While it is true that the author may have acted out of a desire to
celebrate the child's achievements, this does not excuse their blatant disregard
for the parents' feelings. Celebrating a child's milestones should always
involve the parents, as they are the ones who experience the full emotional
weight of these moments. The author’s decision to exclude the parents shows a
lack of consideration for their role and emotions, and that selfishness is what
makes them an asshole. New concise argument for the author being an asshole:
The author acted in a way that was self-centered and dismissive of the parents'
rights to share in their child's milestones. By prioritizing their own
excitement and creating a situation that excluded the parents, the author
demonstrated a fundamental lack of respect for the family's dynamic, making it
clear that their personal enjoyment came at the expense of the parents'
emotional experience. This shows a disregard for the parents' feelings and a
failure to recognize that some moments are not just about the child, but also
about the parents who have invested their hearts and lives into raising that
child.

NTA: NTA says: In response to the YTA argument, it's important to recognize that
the author did not act with the intention of undermining the parents' experience
but rather to celebrate a joyful milestone. While first steps are indeed a
cherished moment for parents, the author's actions may have stemmed from a
genuine desire to share a special moment with the family. They may have thought
the parents would appreciate the excitement and joy of the child’s achievement,
even if they weren’t physically present at that specific moment. Additionally,
the author may not have fully understood the parents' expectations or emotional
investment in the milestone, which highlights the complexity of family dynamics.
Misunderstandings can occur, and the author’s actions might reflect a lack of
awareness rather than an intentional slight. This suggests that the author is
not an asshole but rather someone who misjudged the situation out of enthusiasm.
Furthermore, a new argument for why the author is not an asshole is that they
likely had good intentions in wanting to celebrate the child's development. Many
people celebrate milestones in ways that they believe will bring joy to all
involved. If the author had a history of being supportive in the child's life,
it indicates that they value the family and want to be part of the joyous
moments, which is not an inherently selfish act. Their excitement about the
child's first steps can be seen as a positive expression of love and support
rather than an act of selfishness.

YTA: YTA says: The author is an asshole because they completely disregarded the
significance of a major milestone for the child's parents by prioritizing their
own excitement over the parents' emotional experience. First steps are a
cherished moment for parents, and by facilitating the event without them
present, the author undermined their role and created unnecessary conflict. Even
with good intentions, the author should have respected the parents' desire to
witness such a pivotal moment in their child's development. Refuting the NTA
argument: While it's true the author may have acted out of a desire to
celebrate, this does not absolve them of responsibility for their actions.
Celebrating milestones should always include the parents, who have a fundamental
right to be present for their child's first steps. By excluding the parents, the
author displayed a selfish disregard for their emotional investment in that
moment, prioritizing their own excitement over what should have been a shared
family experience. This shows a clear lack of empathy, which is what makes them
an asshole. New concise argument for the author being an asshole: The author’s
decision to celebrate the child's first steps without the parents present
demonstrates a blatant lack of respect for the parents’ role in their child's
life. By taking the initiative to create this moment without consulting or
including the parents, the author not only undermined their emotional experience
but also showed a disregard for family boundaries and dynamics. This self-
centered behavior reflects an inability to recognize that some milestones are
not just about the child but are deeply emotional for the parents as well,
making the author an asshole for their thoughtlessness.

NTA: NTA says: In response to the YTA argument, it's important to recognize that
the author likely acted with good intentions, wanting to celebrate a milestone
in the child's life. While first steps are indeed significant for parents, the
author's decision may have stemmed from a desire to share a joyous moment rather
than to undermine the parents' experience. They might have believed that the
parents would appreciate the excitement and joy of the child's achievement, even
if it occurred without them present. This suggests that their actions were
rooted in enthusiasm and love, rather than a disregard for the parents'
feelings. Furthermore, it's crucial to consider that family dynamics can be
complex. The author may not have fully grasped the parents' expectations or
emotional investment in the milestone, indicating that their actions were more
about misunderstanding than malice. This complexity highlights that the author
is not necessarily an asshole, but rather someone who misjudged the situation
out of excitement. Additionally, a new argument for why the author is not an
asshole is that they may have intended to create a supportive and celebratory
atmosphere. If the author has a history of being involved and supportive in the
child's life, it demonstrates a commitment to the family unit. Their excitement
about the child's development can be viewed as a positive expression of love and
support, rather than an act of selfishness. In this sense, the author is simply
trying to share in the joy of a significant milestone, which is a natural and
caring response.

argument: While the author's intentions may have been good, that does not excuse
their actions. Celebrating milestones like a child's first steps should
inherently involve the parents, who have a deep emotional connection to the
event. By excluding them, the author demonstrated a lack of awareness and
sensitivity to the parents' feelings. Good intentions don’t negate the fact that
the author acted selfishly and failed to prioritize what should have been a
shared family moment. This shows a clear disregard for the parents' role and
emotional investment, which is why the author is an asshole. New concise
argument for the author being an asshole: The author’s decision to celebrate the
child's first steps without the parents present illustrates a fundamental lack
of respect for their role in the child's life. By taking this moment for
themselves, the author not only diminished the parents' experience but also
displayed a self-centered attitude that prioritizes their own excitement over
the family's emotional needs. This thoughtlessness reveals an inability to
recognize that some milestones are not just about the child, but are deeply
meaningful for the parents, making the author an asshole for their
insensitivity.

NTA: NTA says: In response to the YTA argument, it’s crucial to understand that
the author likely acted out of excitement and love for the child, not with the
intent to undermine the parents' experience. While first steps are indeed a
significant milestone for parents, the author may have believed they were
creating a joyful moment that could be shared later with the parents. Their
actions may reflect a misunderstanding of how to best celebrate this milestone
rather than any malicious intent. This indicates that the author is not an
asshole but simply someone who misjudged the situation in a moment of
enthusiasm. Furthermore, a new argument supporting the author not being an
asshole is that they may have been trying to foster a sense of community and
love within the family. If the author has historically been a supportive figure
in the child's life, this could signify their genuine desire to be part of the
child's growth and celebrate it. Their actions could be seen as an extension of
their affection for the family, which, rather than being selfish, is an
expression of their commitment to being involved and supportive. This shows that
the author is coming from a place of care and not from selfishness, reinforcing
that they are not an asshole in this context.

does not excuse their behavior. The reality is that milestones like first steps
are deeply emotional for parents, and the author's decision to exclude them
shows a fundamental lack of respect for their feelings. Good intentions cannot
erase the fact that the author prioritized their own excitement over the
parents, which reflects a selfish attitude. Their actions demonstrate a clear

from the parents, the author not only diminished the significance of the
milestone but also displayed a self-centered mindset that prioritizes their own
joy over the family's collective experience. This insensitivity to the parents'
feelings showcases a fundamental selfishness, which is what makes the author an

self-centered. Thus, the YTA position wins in this debate.
