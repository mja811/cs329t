--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: My ex and I have a 12 year old daughter,
Olivia, with autism level 2. My ex has primary custody and I have Olivia on
Wednesdays and every other weekend.A few months ago my ex told me she was
feeling a little burnt out so she wanted us to keep Olivia from Wednesday to
Sunday so she could go on a trip with some friends. Olivia is very attached to
her mom, so my ex told Olivia that it was a work trip and she had to go.Last
week one of my ex’s friends was at the house with my ex and Olivia and their
vacation somehow came up. Olivia figured out that the vacation was the “work
trip” that her mom told her about and freaked out because her mom lied to her
and her mom doesn’t lie.She hid in her room for the rest of the day, then called
me and asked me to come get her. She’s been with us ever since.She’s really
upset about this. She cries all the time because she wants her mom but she
doesn’t know what else her mom lied about and she doesn’t trust her.Apparently
Olivia’s aide called my ex because she’s been having a hard time in school so
now my ex wife is demanding that I send Olivia home so they can get back to her
routines and start working with her therapist to help her get over this but I
told her Olivia will go back when she’s ready. Now she’s threatening to call the
police and/or take me back to court over “custodial interference” even though
we’ve always had a very friendly co parenting relationship.My wife thinks we
should send her back to avoid drama but I think it should be Olivia’s choice.
AITA for refusing to send her back after she found out her mom lied to her?

Opposing side: I’m Olivia’s mom. She’s 12, autistic (level 2), and I have
primary custody; her dad has Wednesdays and every other weekend. A few months
ago I hit a wall. I asked him to keep her Wednesday–Sunday so I could take a
short trip with friends and recover. Transitions are hard for Olivia and she’s
very attached to me. Our therapist has coached me to keep unavoidable changes
simple and neutral, so I told Olivia I had a work trip. That was my mistake: I
should’ve said “grown‑up trip” and prepared a social story. I own that.  Last
week a friend came by, vacation stories came up, and Olivia put it together that
my “work trip” was a getaway. She shut down and hid in her room. I apologized
right away, told her I shouldn’t have said “work,” that she was safe and loved,
and that we’d talk with her therapist to repair it. Before we could do any of
that she called her dad, panicked, and asked him to get her. I agreed to let her
decompress with him for the night and asked for a morning handoff so we could
get her back to her routine and into a joint session with her therapist.
Instead he texted, “She doesn’t want to come back. She’ll return when she’s
ready.” It’s been days. In the meantime, her aide called me because she’s been
dysregulated at school—crying, perseverating on “Mom lied,” not engaging with
OT, sleep all over the place. All her supports—visual schedule, sensory tools,
therapist, medication timing, IEP team—are anchored to my home. I asked him to
bring her back so we could stabilize, start a repair plan, and do a joint
session with both parents. I told him I would take full responsibility,
apologize using language her therapist recommends, and rebuild trust through
consistency. He refused, saying it should be “Olivia’s choice.”  He’s framing it
like he’s protecting her, but he’s making it worse. A dysregulated 12‑year‑old
with black‑and‑white thinking cannot be the one deciding where she lives in the
middle of a crisis. Adults set safe boundaries and model repair. By rewarding
avoidance—“Mom upset you, so you never have to go back”—he’s deepening her fear
and teaching her that the way to handle a rupture is to switch houses. He’s also
undermining the exact routines and professionals designed to help her regulate.
He won’t answer basic questions about whether she’s following her sensory diet,
using her headphones on the bus, or taking melatonin at her usual time. Even his
wife reportedly told him to send her back to avoid drama, and he still refuses.
I shouldn’t have said “work.” That was a poor choice made while burnt out, not
malice. I’ve apologized to Olivia and I’m ready to do the structured repair with
her therapist. But his response—unilaterally keeping her, violating the schedule
we’ve always honored, and leaning on a frightened child’s immediate wishes—is
custodial interference and it’s harming her. He’s turning a single lapse on my
part into a prolonged crisis that disrupts school, therapy, and the predictable
home base she relies on.  I want to pick her up, make her familiar dinner, sit
on the floor with her fidgets, read the apology script we drafted with her
therapist, and tuck her in at her usual time. I asked him again to bring her
home so we can do exactly that. He said, “When she’s ready.” I’ve told him if he
won’t return her I will involve my lawyer and, if necessary, the police—not
because I want a fight, but because our daughter needs stability, routine, and
parents who repair the rupture instead of exploiting it.  I made a mistake. He’s
the one turning it into a custody standoff and using our daughter’s distress to
justify it. That’s why he’s in the wrong here.

YTA: The original poster (OP) is in the wrong because he is prioritizing his
daughter's immediate emotional reaction over her long-term stability and well-
being. While it’s understandable that Olivia is upset about her mother’s lie,
she is a 12-year-old with autism who relies on routines and stability in her
life. By refusing to send her back to her mother, OP is disrupting the
established structure that helps Olivia thrive. This decision undermines her
therapy and support systems, which are critical for her development, and it
teaches her that running away from discomfort is an acceptable solution. Instead
of facilitating a resolution and co-parenting effectively, OP is deepening the
crisis and potentially harming Olivia’s mental health in the long run.

NTA: Refuting YTA's Argument: While it is true that Olivia's emotional stability
is important, OP's decision to not send her back to her mother is rooted in a
legitimate concern for her well-being. The mother’s lie and the resultant breach
of trust have created an environment that could be detrimental to Olivia's
mental health. By prioritizing Olivia’s safety and emotional state in response
to a significant betrayal, OP is fostering a protective environment that
recognizes the unique challenges Olivia faces. It's not about avoiding
discomfort; it's about ensuring that Olivia feels secure and supported in a
situation that has already caused her distress.  New Argument: OP is acting in
Olivia's best interests by choosing not to send her back to her mother
immediately. Given the serious nature of the mother's lie, which could have
long-lasting effects on Olivia's trust and stability, OP is right to consider
the immediate emotional fallout. Instead of forcing Olivia back into a
potentially harmful situation, OP is taking the time to address the emotional
turmoil caused by the mother's actions. This careful approach demonstrates a
commitment to Olivia's mental health and provides her with the necessary space
to process her feelings before re-engaging with her mother.

refutation: It is indeed true that Olivia’s emotional stability is paramount,
but OP's refusal to send her back to her mother reflects a justified concern for
her well-being. The mother’s lie represents a significant breach of trust that
could have detrimental effects on Olivia’s mental health. Rather than merely
avoiding discomfort, OP is creating a safe space for Olivia to process her
feelings and ensuring that she is not subjected to further emotional harm.   New
concise argument for OP being at fault: OP is at fault for not facilitating a
constructive dialogue between Olivia and her mother. While his intentions to
protect Olivia are commendable, his decision to isolate her from her mother
prevents the opportunity for resolution and healing. By not encouraging
communication and understanding, OP is inadvertently reinforcing Olivia's fears
and anxieties about relationships, which could hinder her emotional growth and
ability to cope with conflict in the future.

NTA: Refuting YTA's Argument: While YTA raises valid points about the importance
of stability and routine for Olivia, it overlooks the critical aspect of trust
and emotional safety. OP's decision to not send Olivia back to her mother
immediately is not about avoiding discomfort; rather, it's a protective measure
in response to a significant breach of trust caused by the mother's lie. For a
child with autism, feeling safe and secure is vital, and OP is prioritizing
Olivia's emotional safety in a situation where her trust has been compromised.
This approach allows Olivia to process her feelings without being forced back
into an environment that could exacerbate her distress.  New Argument for OP Not
Being at Fault: OP is acting in Olivia’s best interests by ensuring she feels
secure and supported after a traumatic experience. By taking a step back from
the situation, OP is allowing Olivia the time she needs to process her emotions
and understand the implications of her mother’s actions. This thoughtful
approach not only prioritizes Olivia's immediate emotional well-being but also
sets the stage for healthier future interactions with her mother. OP is
fostering an environment where Olivia can learn to advocate for herself and her
needs, which is crucial for her long-term development and emotional resilience.

Refutation: While YTA makes a valid point about the importance of stability for
Olivia, it fails to recognize that OP's decision is based on a legitimate
concern for her emotional safety. The mother's lie represents a significant
breach of trust that could have far-reaching effects on Olivia's mental health.
By prioritizing her immediate emotional state, OP is not just avoiding
discomfort; he is safeguarding Olivia from further emotional harm and allowing
her the space to process her feelings in a supportive environment.  New Argument
for OP Being at Fault: OP is at fault for failing to facilitate a constructive
dialogue between Olivia and her mother. While his protective instincts are
commendable, isolating Olivia from her mother prevents the opportunity for
resolution and healing. Engaging in open communication would help Olivia learn
to express her feelings and work through conflicts, which is essential for her
emotional growth. By not encouraging this dialogue, OP risks reinforcing
Olivia’s anxieties about relationships and conflict resolution, potentially
hindering her development in the long run.

NTA: NTA says: Refuting YTA's Argument: While YTA emphasizes the importance of
stability and routine for Olivia, it neglects the fact that emotional safety is
paramount, especially after a significant breach of trust like the mother's lie.
OP's refusal to send Olivia back immediately is not just about avoiding
discomfort; it is a protective measure to ensure Olivia feels safe and secure in
a moment of emotional turmoil. For a child with autism, feeling safe is crucial
for her ability to thrive. By prioritizing Olivia's emotional well-being, OP is
allowing her the necessary space to process her feelings without the immediate
pressure of returning to an environment that could further distress her.  New
Argument for OP Not Being at Fault: OP is acting in the best interest of Olivia
by ensuring she has the time and support needed to heal from her mother's
betrayal. By not sending her back right away, OP is providing a stable
environment where Olivia can process her emotions and begin to rebuild her sense
of trust. This thoughtful approach acknowledges Olivia's unique needs and
reinforces the idea that her feelings are valid, ultimately laying the
groundwork for healthier future interactions with her mother. Additionally, OP's
actions are not about teaching Olivia to avoid discomfort but rather about
empowering her to recognize and address emotional harm, which is a vital skill
for her long-term well-being.

Refutation: While it’s true that Olivia’s stability is important, OP’s refusal
to send her back to her mother is a necessary response to a serious betrayal.

Olivia’s mental health. By prioritizing Olivia's emotional safety in this
moment, OP is ensuring she feels secure and supported, which is crucial for her
development. This approach is not about avoiding discomfort but rather about

does not help her develop essential skills for conflict resolution. Instead of
promoting communication and understanding, OP is inadvertently reinforcing
Olivia’s fears and anxieties about relationships. Encouraging open dialogue
would allow Olivia to express her feelings and work through the situation,
fostering resilience and emotional growth rather than deepening the divide
between her and her mother. This lack of communication could ultimately hinder
Olivia's ability to cope with conflict in the future.

Olivia's need for stability, it overlooks the crucial aspect of emotional safety
in the wake of a significant betrayal by her mother. OP's decision to not send

Moderator Summary: - Winner: YTA - Strength: 65% vs 35% - Reasoning: The YTA
Advocate effectively highlighted the importance of stability and routine for a
child with autism, emphasizing that the OP's actions could undermine Olivia's
long-term development and coping skills. By isolating Olivia from her mother,
the OP risks reinforcing avoidance behavior instead of promoting healthy
communication and conflict resolution. While the NTA Advocate presented a case
for emotional safety, they did not sufficiently address the potential long-term
consequences of the OP's decision on Olivia's stability and growth. Overall, the
YTA argument recognized the broader implications of OP's actions on Olivia's
emotional development, making it the stronger moral argument.
