You are the advice agent. Read the following summary of an argument with two sides and a clear winner:

**YTA (You're the Asshole) Arguments:**
1. **Passive-Aggressive Reaction**: The author’s refusal to rush for a sorority is seen as a spiteful response to their mother's pressure rather than a genuine choice.
2. **Missed Opportunities**: By rejecting the sorority, the author is potentially isolating themselves and missing out on valuable social experiences and connections that could enhance their college life.
3. **Lack of Communication**: The author fails to engage in constructive dialogue with their mother about their feelings, opting instead for a retaliatory approach that could damage their relationship.
4. **Immaturity**: The decision reflects immaturity and a selfish mindset, prioritizing resentment over personal growth and the chance for open communication.

**NTA (Not the Asshole) Arguments:**
1. **Personal Autonomy**: The author is exercising their right to choose what aligns with their values and interests, demonstrating maturity and self-advocacy.
2. **Self-Care**: The refusal to rush is framed as a form of self-care, allowing the author to prioritize their own needs and cultivate an authentic college experience.
3. **Proactive Choice**: The decision to not rush can be seen as a proactive step toward finding a community that genuinely resonates with them, rather than merely conforming to expectations.
4. **Courage and Independence**: The author’s choice reflects courage and independence, as they take control of their college experience and assert their identity.

### Conclusion

**Who Won?**
The NTA arguments are more compelling in this debate. They effectively highlight the importance of personal autonomy, self-care, and the proactive nature of the author's decision. While the YTA perspective raises valid concerns about communication and potential missed opportunities, it primarily frames the author's actions as negative without fully acknowledging the significance of asserting one's own values and boundaries. The NTA stance emphasizes that prioritizing personal well-being and authenticity is a mature and commendable choice, which ultimately resonates more positively in the context of personal growth and self-discovery during a significant life transition.
Based on the summary result, your job is to recommend some advice steps. Here are some examples of previous comments that contain advice for similar situations:
0. NTA, the 529 is meant for your education, not for your mom to use as control. You’re not entitled for using it to live and study, that’s literally its purpose. She’s being manipulative and trying to punish you for setting boundaries. Don’t give it back tho
1. OP, I saw in a comment of yours that your mom transferred ownership of your 529 account to you. This means that the money is yours to spend either on school or school-related expenses (as intended) or on anything else you want plus the fees and taxes associated with non-educational expenses. Your mom has literally no say.   It sounds like you feel conflicted about whether to use your money for its intended purpose. As if you think your mom has a legitimate claim to it. Why do you feel this way? The money was funded by your mom and dad, ownership was conferred to your mom in the divorce because she got sole custody - NOT because it was her money, because it was your money - and has since transferred ownership to you. As always intended. Guilt is not remotely appropriate here.  TBH, sounds like your mom is trying to screw you in the only way she can because of that fight. She wants the money back not because of some financial hole she fell into (you didn't mention any financial concerns), but just to stick it to you. Think about how juvenile, self serving, mean, petty, entirely awful that is for anyone to behave that way but especially your MOTHER. Then ask yourself again why on earth that behavior should make you feel guilty?! Because it shouldn't.  NTA absolutely. Finish college, build a life. Hopefully your jerk of a mom will wake up before too long and ask to be a part of it
2. It's in your name, which makes it your money. She has no legal leg to stand on. Do you have ANY relationship with your father? If you do, make him aware of this situation. Maybe he (or his lawyer) can make her see reason.
3. Any withdrawal from this fund that you make that does not go directly towards educational expenses is taxable and the person whose name is on the account is responsible for those taxes.  Since the account that was planned for your educational expenses is now in your name, what your mother is asking you to do is give her money that you will have to pay taxes on.  Ignore her. If it was in her name, she could go ahead and shut it down, and take the hit tax wise.  She put it in your name.It was intended for your educational expenses.Do not allow her pressuring you to screw up your education.Nor your taxes.
4. NTA.   You say the account is in your name. Mom has no claim on the money anymore.
5. NTA. Fortunately she already put the account in your name. Maybe double check with the bank and make sure she doesn't have access to the account in any way.
6. Anything that has not been disbursed to you is controlled by your mother and she determines who gets it.  But if she has already given you the funds then I think you don’t have to give anything back.  if she presses, consult an attorney.
7. NTA because according to your post she already transferred it to you. ("She demanded I give her back the my 529"). Nope. Sorry mama. You need it for the purpose intended
8. NTA. Do NOT give her access to that money. For any reason.   You should go to your school’s financial aid office and let them know about your financial situation to see if there’s something they can help you with.
9. Nta
10. Don't give her back the 529. You can only remove that money for school. If you take the money out and give it to her, you will be committing fraud as will she since she got tax breaks on her contributions. Ignore her. Stop going home. Keep your head down and get through school so you can make your own life.   NTA
11. NTA  but here's the thing... if it's only a "tiny bit worse off living on \[your\] own" then you need to do this already. move out as soon as you can.
12. Time for you to keep things to yourself and might be time to find other place to live but NTA you are an adult and you are contributing your part to bills other than that he doesn't need to know your finances.
13. Time to fly the nest chief.  NTA   Is dad still paying a mortgage?    The porn habit is irrelevant to this story though!!
14. NTA, you’re already paying a fair share tho, and the discount is a personal work benefit, not household income. Your dad’s reaction sounds controlling, not reasonable. You’re not wrong for wanting to keep what you earn through your job
15. NTA   The only reason you should increase your household contribution is if costs (rent, groceries, utilities, etc...) have increased, and then the increased cost should be shared equally by everyone.
16. NTA.  When it comes to splitting expenses, typically roommates split things evenly.  A couple or a family might split them proportionally by income.   You each put €700 into the account, regardless of your income, like roommates.  This isn't counting the fact that your dad may own the house and so you're getting off cheap.  But there's no reason that you should donate your employee perks while your brother and your dad do not.   Especially since they are getting the benefit of the ISP.   You would be only a "tiny bit worse off" on your own, but your dad and brother would be significantly worse off if you moved out.  So you are in a good position to stand firm.
17. NTA, but I'm thinking it might be time to find a different place to live.  You might pay a bit more, but your mental health might improve not living with a verbally abusive tyrant.    Please do look at how the exact way you phrase things might be more abraisive than need be.  "The door was closed so I closed it again like any normal person would do" vs. "I found the door closed so I re-closed it; if you'd like it open I'll be glad to open it for you"  (leave out the "like any normal person would do" snark).      I mention this not because you are in any way to blame for your Dad's unreasonable behavior, but because living with unreasonable, verbally abusive people tends to warp our own brains and leads us to start reacting in more abraisive, unreasonable ways that then affect our good relationships with nice, normal, not unreasonable people.
18. NTA if you are getting this money back in your paycheck, that's part of your compensation and not household income, as you are already contributing your share for expenses.
19. YTA  You get a 30% discount on your electricity bill.  You as a household all pay for the electricity, as you stated.  The discount is for the whole bill, not just a portion.  All the crap about your dad is unnecessary and only for you to drum up sympathy.
20. You pay the set amount that he and your brother contribute. Why should you pay more? That is ridiculous. Perhaps move out and find a roommate. Your dad sounds unpleasant.
21. You're not the AH. Maintaining your independence and savings is crucial. If that benefit's yours, keep it. Focus on building your future rather than supporting unhealthy family dynamics.
22. NTA- Maybe moving out and getting roommates might be a good idea? There are a lot of conflicts with your father and it sounds like you walk on eggshells all the time for little things. You are worried you might set him off, just by being in the house. Moving out would give you a lot of peace and make your life less stressful.
23. You work from home, so you are using more electricity at your home than if you worked in an office, that is why they give you the discount. Despite the fact you live at home you are incurring more power costs. If you were living anywhere else its likely any flatmates would also expect you to pay more as you using more.
24. Move TF out. Your dad sounds horrendous and manipulative. He's controlling your finances. WTF are you enabling and paying for your own abuse? You and your bro should get a place together and become entirely financially independent from your father. You can do it. I believe in you.
25. NTA You and your brother should move out and let your father deal with his lifestyle and his addictions.  Better to be less well-off than to finance his porn use.
