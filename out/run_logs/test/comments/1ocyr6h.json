  "selftext": "Posting this before I go to bed maybe regret it tomorrow morning anyway, for some context: I live in an Asian household and like the stereotypes my mom has always been a straight-A student and top of her school, my older sibling has always been praised for being super smart from a young age. Me? I struggle with school. I wasn't always like this, and my grades aren't bad, they're just not all As.   I've switched to online classes and so my mom said that I shouldn't have bad grades or missing work etc. I've been doing good so far, I've had some missing assignments here and there but end up turning them in late (but no late penalty) and my assignments are always in the range of 85%-100% but for some classes even with those percentages the total grade is like a D or C (It's a whole thing) I told my mom about it when she asked about my grades, she agreed it was strange.  One night after I when out with my friends she yelled at me for not turning in all of my assignments and etc same conversation from before. She kept switching what she was mad about every time I tried to explain myself. She told me no going out unless I turn in all of my assignments. I did all of my work and then I thought that was the end of it.  Since then, she would constantly ask about my grades. It gets on my nerves. She's been asking about literally nothing but school work, so obviously whenever she mentions school again I get a little agitated, but I don't want to get in trouble I don't say anything. When I get agitated I close my door a little too hard, or I walk a little too loud, and etc. So she would say \"why are you so mad?\" and \"I guess I won't tell you to do anything\" (Not exact words but I can't exactly translate it)  Today was when things sort of \"blew up\". Not sure how it even started but basically, my family (mom, dad, sibling) sat me down and said I need a better schedule/routine and etc. They told me things as if I could follow routines best fit for them, and maybe I could but it wouldn't be best for *me*. Later my mom and dad were talking and asked me why I was \"throwing a fit\" (not sure what they word they used is in English but that's close to it) and I said that I'm allowed to have emotions. Later my mom came into my room and asked why I'm mad at her, then I blew up. I told her, while sobbing, that I'm tired of her always talking about school and that I'm really trying my hardest, and that I can't take it whenever she talks about school. I told her that she hasn't talked to me about anything but school. She completely missed the point, she kept telling me that she has to so that my grades would be better. I honestly don't know what she was talking about because I was so shocked at her response. She ended the conversation with \"I'm too scared to even talk to you\" (another rough translation). Me and mom are super close, the post may not seem like it but it's true, I love her more than anyone. That's why I don't know what to do, so am I the asshole?",
