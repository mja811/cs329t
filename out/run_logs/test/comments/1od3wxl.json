    "NTA Your parents are abusing you emotionally and financially. Get them out of your home as fast as you can.",
    "NTA Coersive control csn happen in non romantic relationships. You need to move out for your mental health and independence.",
    "NTA  Stop paying their bills. If your dad refuses to do online banking, that's his problem, not yours.  Try and write up the ways he used to manipulate you, and figure out adequate counters in advance. You might also use the pop-the-why-stack method. Every time he says he can't do something, ask why. \"I can't pay this bill.\" Why? \"I don't have online banking.\" Why? and so on. This way you finally arrive to the fact it's his choice not to do something - and that's where you point out it's not an accident or fate, he has choosen this way.  You might also calculate, just in case, how much they have saved by living with you. Should your dad make a show for \"giving you money\", you can then show how much you have actually given him by paying the rent and utilities.  Create an action plan with specific cutoff dates, and allow your family a reasonable response time. That is, don't tell your folks to move out within 2 weeks, maybe in two or three months. Or, announce you will terminate the lease in three months, and will move to a place of your own. Then it's up to your parents to figure out where they are moving - but not with you.",
    "Find another place to move to, but don't tell them until you've signed the contract.   &gt; I am tired of being manipulated, micromanaged and treated as a child   Then you say that.   If you really want to drive home the point that it's just you moving, get a place that would be too small for all of you.   NTA. Sorry that you're going through this, it sounds stressful.",
    "Not only YWNBTA, personally I think you need to do this for your mental health and personal well-being. You are so enmeshed with your parents that you feel you cannot say no to them, and your inability to set any meaningful boundaries with your family is enabling your father's \"helpless\" behavior and your brother is perfectly happy to let you shoulder the whole load as long as he's not inconvienienced.  These people have been taking advantage of you for years, of course they won't like it when their free ride is gone and do everything they can to keep you wrapped up in their needs. It benefits them for you to serve them, but that's not love. When your father says \"Oh so you mean you want all of us to go separate ways\" have you considered that the answer might be yes?  Your parents are adults, they are not broke, they will figure things out if you stop paying everything for them and managing all their emotional needs. If your only options are \"be a self-sacrificing doormat for the rest of your life\" or \"be seen as a b\\*tch for insisting on my humanity\", humanity wins. In addition to moving out and separating your finances, I really really hope you can get some therapy. When you're living in a dynamic like this it's almost impossible to see how much it affects you and how deep it goes. Wishing you the best.",
    "NTA.  My dear, you are an independent adult human being, and not a beast of burden.  You are not obliged to let your parents load you up until all that can be seen are the tips of your ears like an overworked donkey.  If anyone gives you trouble over it, tell them that they\u2019re welcome to host your parents for a few years and see how they feel about being used that way.",
    "NTA.  You\u2019re an adult, entitled to an independent life, too.   And, as you said, it\u2019s not like your parents really depend on you, under their control a useful tool they don\u2019t want to lose. Hence the emotional blackmailing.  According to what you said, you will be hard judged regardless of what you do. Then, you might as well move out and get better privacy and financial stability while at it.",
    "NTA but if THEY live with YOU, why would YOU move out? Or do you mean you're renting &amp; would just break/not renew the lease? Either way, yeah, get out.",
    "NTA  And it's kind of sad you need to ask us on this. There's being nice and letting yourself be used. Letting them use you for 5 years like this makes me think your level of tolerance for people's bullshit is so high you're going to end up being used by someone else as soon as you cut them off. You would be well within your rights to never speak to them again.",
    "NTA   \"Brother, I have had our parents for 5 years, it is only fair that you take them now\"   Tell them you are going to downsize to a smaller apartment and do it, they can keep the apartment you have, or move in with brother.   Stop letting the guilt get to you. Block them if you need to.",
    "NTA I guess you realise now why your brother don't want them. They are major AH for not wanting to contribute, any parent with a ounce of compassionate who moves into their adult child house should want to pitch in financially and physically to pull their own weight. Kick them out, your father should have enough money saved up to get their own place they will be fine.",
    "My Dear OP, your parents' goal is to make your life solely devoted to them and for you to be their spinster caretaker until they die.\u00a0 They are financially abusing you, curtailing your social opportunities where you could meet a husband, and enlisting your family into guilt tripping you into taking complete responsibility for them so no one else in the family has to.\u00a0 Your parents are setting you up.  You can\u2019t force them to change, so moving out and distancing yourself IS your healthiest choice.\u00a0 YWNBTA because it is crucial to prioritize your own well-being.  Here\u2019s a resource for understanding family manipulation [https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/family-manipulation](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/family-manipulation)  Here's a guide of how to escape abusive parents for adults - [https://hopefulpanda.com/how-to-escape-abusive-parents-for-adults/](https://hopefulpanda.com/how-to-escape-abusive-parents-for-adults/)  * Map out as much of your move as possible and hide or erase every evidence of it from your parents.\u00a0 Don\u2019t say you\u2019re leaving no matter what you do. Do not tell your parents you are leaving or give any indication or hints that you are or will be. If your parents find out, they will do everything in their power to make you stay. * Save as much money as you can * Lease a new place or find a friend\u2019s place to stay without telling them. Gather your important documents like birth certificate, social security card, etc., into a safe place. * Either slowly move out the rest of your belongings so they don't notice or move out your things while they are not at home. (Once, I rented a U-Haul &amp; movers and moved a friend out of their abusive ex's apartment in one day.) * Move out without any notice.\u00a0 You owe them nothing. * STAY GONE. No matter what they say or promise or do, don\u2019t fall for it because a[busive people do not change](https://hopefulpanda.com/can-abusive-parents-change/).  You already have sacrificed 5 yrs of your life for wealthy parents who care nothing for your happiness.\u00a0 Update us and Good Luck!",
    "moving out sounds like a necessary step. As for the guilt trip, they\u2019ll likely use it, but you can\u2019t let it control you. You deserve a life free from that constant manipulation",
    "Are you an immigrant by chance? I find that my immigrant girlfriends have similar stories as they are shamed for wanting independence here in America while the brothers are never scrutinized.

You need to learn how to be the villain in others people\u2019s rendition of stories &amp; not care.",
    "NTA. Are you Asian by any chance OP? My mum lived with me until a few months ago (I'm 34F), moving out only when we organised a flat for her through our local council. She's now living on her own for the first time in her life at the age of 80. Yes we still need to help her out with bills and things because she's a massive technophobe and my sis and I ha e applied for power of attorney? But - big surprise - turns out she's quite capable of living by herself even though she resisted the idea for decades. I got married this summer so finally had an \"acceptable\" reason to sell my old flat where she was living with me and unmesh ourselves from each other's lives. Guess what? She survived.",
    "NTA  Please reread everything you wrote and honestly consider how you could be wrong for wanting to live your own life? Your father is an abusive asshole. You need to get out immediately and NEVER look back.",
    "NTA and also be careful that dad isn't planning to give everything to your sibling. I'm an estate planning attorney and can't tell you how many parents screw over the care taker/provider because they think the daughter's husband will pay for her or the like. It doesn't matter to them how much effort or time or money of your own that you've expended. They will always make you to be the bad guy if you want a change. total manipulation.   You need to create and enforce boundaries and know that while you are doing that, your family will likely guilt the hell out of you or make you out to be the bad guy which is just more manipulation to try and get you to not make your changes so they don't have to deal with anything. Total BS.",
    "Girl, get outta that mess.",
    "NTA. Better to be called a b*tch than waste the best years of your life taking care of people who are using you for their own convenience. You can\u2019t get back that time so stop delaying or worrying about what people will think! You aren\u2019t a b%tch for wanting your own life and independence, and anyone who tries to tell you different is an AH who is only looking out for their own interests.",

    "You are NTA. As a parent, please listen: get out of there! I am utterly appalled by their behavior, and they are using you and abusing you. They have savings. They are adults who can manage payment systems. You need to care for yourself. And shame on your brother for not helping you in this. Your situation is unreasonable, and you need to separate for your own well-being - emotional and financial.",
    "NTA call you need to live your life for you, not for them.  Have a sitdown conversation with them and tell them going forward this is how it\u2019s gonna be. You\u2019re gonna be the tenant. I\u2019m the landlord and you start paying the bills because I\u2019m moving out if they don\u2019t like it tell him you\u2019re putting the house up for sale and everyone\u2019s going their separate ways.",
    "NTA  Go. Live your life. It's long past time.  Don't give them your address. Refuse to be guilted. Hang up on anyone who tries to guilt you. Ignore their texts. If you're visiting them, leave. Let me repeat...do not give them your address.",
    "NTA. So your parents are using you for their day-to-day expenses while controlling you to keep you specifically in the position where they can continue exploiting you? Did I get that right?  Don't move out - run. You are being financially abused and heavily manipulated to keep the abuse on-going. They have two other children. They have chosen to make you what is known as the \"responsible\" one. That's the one they use as their retirement plan.  You are gong to find out exactly how dysfunctional all of this is when you stop being exactly what they want you to be - their ATM.",
    "NTA.  They are the parents and they need to live by their means, not off of their child.  Sit them down and say that it has been taxing on you and you need to move on to live your own life and have a social life other than them.  If they ask if it is to go separate ways?  Yes, as in everyday life but you still want occassional visits.",
    "They are going to put a lot of pressure on you. I would make arrangements to rent a deposit and not tell them for a week or two before you move in.\u00a0  They are going to guilt you but be strong. They don\u2019t need you to live with them.",

    "YWNBTA I bet your brother is favored more than you with presents and praise and will also get more than you from their will. Please get out. You can make it very factual: \u201cI cannot afford to support myself plus you. I\u2019m moving out and you two can live on your own or see if brother will take you in.\u201d Then repeat this every time they try to guilt trip you. Do not let them negotiate. It\u2019s too late to start helping with the bills or to give you tje respect and space you deserve.",
    "First, find a therapist who will support you moving towards independence and help you not cave in to the drama coming. When does your lease expire? Can you find a smaller place that works for you? When you are ready (have support in place), tell your parents you are not renewing the lease, and your new place will not include space for them. They survived for 25 years before they moved in with you. If you have been paying most of their bills for 5 years, they should be out of debt and have a chuck of money saved.   Don't ask your brother to house them. Don't figure out where they are going for them. It's not your job. You will never have a family of your own while they drain you financially and emotionally. Their retirement plan is YOU!",
    "NTA.   No, you would be making a normal human decision. Loving parents would encourage you to live independently if that is what you want and have the means to do so.   But why do your parents need to live with you or your brother? From what you write it sounds like are financially able to support themselves. They just don't want to.",
    "After you leave your parents and start living indepently, you may have difficulty in making decisions. My guess is your parents always have to approve or disapprove any decision you make, or not let you make any decisions.   Most decisions you make won't be a matter of right or wrong, or legality, but of preference. What I've found useful is to distinguish between wants and needs--needs trump wants, and also to ask yourself what is the wiser option for you in your current circumstances. But if it's about your clothing, or how to style your hair or what shoes to buy, that's just your preference. Don't take into consideration if your parents would approve or not.\u00a0   Your brother might be an ally to support you in living independently as long as you don't expect him to pick up your slack with the parents.If you can trust him not to tattle on you to your parents.",

We teach people how to treat us - that\u2019s not a diss it\u2019s actually a beautiful thing because it means you have the power to change this. I\u2019m not seeing any real reason they need to live with either of their adult children so if they wanted to move in with your brother that would be his decision. I hear you that you\u2019ll definitely face attack for prioritizing yourself but is that worse than current life? I say go for it, be free, move forward. YWNBTA",
    "NTA  But more than that you should also seek therapy immediately.  You are emotionally stunted to even question this at 30.  You need a reality check to help you get your life started.  And I mean that in the nicest way possible.",
    "YWNBTA- . Your parents won't become independent unless they're made to. And your brother won't participate or get involved unless he has to. Just get an apartment and set a move out date. Tell your parents when you're moving. Don't ask. Don't even debate it. When they throw the guilt trips at you just respond \"I'm sorry you feel that way\". Don't debate your brother either. If he asks you what will Mom and Dad do, tell him \"I have no idea\".",

    "When the lease is coming up to renew, find a new place and warn your parents you\u2019re downsizing to a smaller place because paying their bills has become a financial problem and you need a space of your own so they\u2019ll need to get their own place or move in with your brother.",

    "You are an adult now and they want to take advantage of you. It\u2019s healthy to move into your own place and stop this co-dependency. You aren\u2019t doing them any favors by allowing them to mooch and not support themselves. NTA. It\u2019s time.",

    "NTA Save yourself and kick these freeloaders to the curb.   It should be YOUR CHOICE if they live with you.  Time to send them  to brothers house and bar the door.  Do you want to have a life of your own?  Then you need to break this pattern and nobody is going to be happy about it.",
    "Why is it that it\u2019s okay for your brother to have a life, yet your parents aren\u2019t letting you.  They had a life and even retired.  Go live your life, ignore all the crying,guilt etc.   now it\u2019s your time.",
    "NTA- these relationships are always difficult even when you don't have the controlling dynamic.  It is very hard to shift into a roommate type arrangement when they or you are used to being in control.    You need to move out in order to establish your own household and routines.  Unfortunately, that means they will be in an either sink or swim situation. That's on them, not on you.",

    "No, you would not. Please do so with a light heart and enjoy your new freedom and independence. Make sure your parents do not have access to any of your accounts and do not have any debit orders on your accounts.  YWNBTA.",

  "selftext": "I am a 30F and my parents have been living with me for the past 5 years (I pay for rent, utilities and most expenses). It is completely out their choice, I don't need them to live with me. I have an elder brother who is married, both of them work. He earns as much as me and SIL earns a bit lesser. But since parents don't live with him, he's not asked to pitch in for any recurring expenses. I don't think he would say no but he's not come forward to pitch in either. Though I don't think he particularly wants to live full time with them. Everytime I have broached the topic, he's dodged it.  My relationship with my father is fraught. While I love him, he still likes to extend control over my life and treat my finances as his.  He's manipulative and everytime I ask him to pick up a few of their bills, he goes \"Oh so you mean you want all of us to go separate ways\" etc.   While he has significant savings, he refuses to get a debit card or credit card or adopt any app that would enable him to make digital payments - sort of a forced financial dependence. He knows how to use all these financial devices and had a good career in the government before retiring. Instead he asks me to make all the payments. If I push back a little bit, he makes a show of \"giving me money because I asked for it\" and guilt tripping me.   I am tired of being manipulated, micromanaged and treated as a child even though I'm the one taking care of everything. I've given up a lot of my social life over the past 5 years because they're quite controlling/need me/manipulative. This is not just financial but in daily life as well. I want to move out and reduce expenses and increase my savings which would make them move in with my brother that too after much guilt tripping bs and me appearing as a the bitch in the family.
