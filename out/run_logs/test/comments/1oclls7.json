    "Info so it\u2019s her money right?  Like she\u2019s the one that put it in the 529?",
    "It\u2019s actually unlikely she transferred ownership to you. You are most likely just the designated beneficiary. It\u2019s still her money."

    "NTA, the 529 is meant for your education, not for your mom to use as control. You\u2019re not entitled for using it to live and study, that\u2019s literally its purpose. She\u2019s being manipulative and trying to punish you for setting boundaries. Don\u2019t give it back tho",
    "OP, I saw in a comment of yours that your mom transferred ownership of your 529 account to you. This means that the money is yours to spend either on school or school-related expenses (as intended) or on anything else you want plus the fees and taxes associated with non-educational expenses. Your mom has literally no say.   It sounds like you feel conflicted about whether to use your money for its intended purpose. As if you think your mom has a legitimate claim to it. Why do you feel this way? The money was funded by your mom and dad, ownership was conferred to your mom in the divorce because she got sole custody - NOT because it was her money, because it was your money - and has since transferred ownership to you. As always intended. Guilt is not remotely appropriate here.  TBH, sounds like your mom is trying to screw you in the only way she can because of that fight. She wants the money back not because of some financial hole she fell into (you didn't mention any financial concerns), but just to stick it to you. Think about how juvenile, self serving, mean, petty, entirely awful that is for anyone to behave that way but especially your MOTHER. Then ask yourself again why on earth that behavior should make you feel guilty?! Because it shouldn't.  NTA absolutely. Finish college, build a life. Hopefully your jerk of a mom will wake up before too long and ask to be a part of it",
    "It's in your name, which makes it your money. She has no legal leg to stand on. Do you have ANY relationship with your father? If you do, make him aware of this situation. Maybe he (or his lawyer) can make her see reason.",
    "Any withdrawal from this fund that you make that does not go directly towards educational expenses is taxable and the person whose name is on the account is responsible for those taxes.  Since the account that was planned for your educational expenses is now in your name, what your mother is asking you to do is give her money that you will have to pay taxes on.  Ignore her. If it was in her name, she could go ahead and shut it down, and take the hit tax wise.  She put it in your name.It was intended for your educational expenses.Do not allow her pressuring you to screw up your education.Nor your taxes.",
    "NTA.   You say the account is in your name. Mom has no claim on the money anymore.",
    "NTA. Fortunately she already put the account in your name. Maybe double check with the bank and make sure she doesn't have access to the account in any way.",
    "Anything that has not been disbursed to you is controlled by your mother and she determines who gets it.  But if she has already given you the funds then I think you don\u2019t have to give anything back.  if she presses, consult an attorney.",
    "NTA because according to your post she already transferred it to you. (\"She demanded I give her back the my 529\"). Nope. Sorry mama. You need it for the purpose intended",
    "NTA. Do NOT give her access to that money. For any reason.   You should go to your school\u2019s financial aid office and let them know about your financial situation to see if there\u2019s something they can help you with.",
    "Nta",
    "Don't give her back the 529. You can only remove that money for school. If you take the money out and give it to her, you will be committing fraud as will she since she got tax breaks on her contributions. Ignore her. Stop going home. Keep your head down and get through school so you can make your own life.   NTA"

  "INFO": [
    "INFO: does she have any right for this money?  Most likely though, based on her reasoning behind asking, NTA. Idk how you got along with her overall if she is willing to try to make you go into debt. I would ignore or her or at least see what she could potentially do to that money if she goes further.",
    "NTA, the 529 is a tax incentive account. Your mother has already reaped the benefits. Please remember that REGARDLESS of the 529 you are eligible for student aid, counselling services and any other college support. Do right by yourself.",
    "Everything depends on who is the \u201cowner\u201d of the 529. If your Mother\u2019s name is on it. She can legally take the money and pay taxes on the dispersal. If the account is in your name only then it is yours to use for your education. Unfortunately, most likely your Mom holds the cards. Sadly, because you are under 25 she needs to give you her tax returns for your FAFSA. I\u2019m sorry OP, It sucks for you. Be prepared for more student loans.",
    "NTA. That money was put aside so you could go to school.  It is yours. Your parent\u2019s taxes were lower because that money was yours. Don\u2019t feel guilty.  You can and should limit contact for your mental health.  You can always re-establish communication later. ( difficult but possible. I did after 3 years) good luck. Please don\u2019t waste your education on a major that will not give you a living wage once you graduate.  Also go to grad school as soon as you are able. It is easier before you have a family to support and a full time job."

  "selftext": "VERY long story short...I am in undergrad right now and left home a few months ago after a particularly bad fight with my mother. For context, I only live there during the summers when I'm home from school. Her and I have always gotten along, but she has always been very volatile and has been abusive at times and that has caused strain on the relationship. This summer was a bit of a breaking point, and I left home before I was supposed to because she got so angry she insisted she didn't want to live with me anymore. I have since stopped most contact with her and she is very upset. This past weekend, she demanded I give her back the my 529 (for those who don't know, this is a special savings account you can use to pay for educational expenses). My dilemma is that I am completely on my own financially and literally cannot live without this money...I live off campus and cannot afford food or tuition or rent without the 529. She insists I should take out loans like she did and that I am acting entitled for refusing to give her the money back. What do you all think?",
