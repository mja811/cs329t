    "YTA. It is your money, but the asshole part is why wouldn't you *want* to get your mom something over your aunt? Or buy them both something small?  Either we are missing some major context, or you really are TA, majorly.",
    "YTA. Unless you don't have a relationship with your mother it's just rude and mean to prioritize your aunt over her. You should have gotten them both small gifts.",
    "YTA. This need to budget for the birthdays of the two women who have loved and cared for you all of your life is not new. Have you considered thinking ahead so you might budget for this \u201cdouble-gift\u201d month? Or putting in the time or effort to make a thoughtful gift? Or finding ways to earn money by taking on extra chores around your house? Or perhaps preparing a birthday meal for them both?   You had options.  And you seemed to have intentionally opted for the one that would hurt your mother\u2019s feelings. On her birthday.",
    "You get $40/month for allowance, and you couldn't buy two gifts?  I see (in other comments) that you're young, but...YTA.",
    "Wow YTA. Do you even like your mom??I get your aunt is important to you and it's wonderful you got her a gift but is your mom NOT important to you?   How old are you because you could have MADE her something. Drew her a picture, painted her something, or ANYTHING.",
    "A soft YTA here because I feel like there's gotta be some context we are missing.  I feel like you must be young, because you're still getting cash allowance from your parents. That suggests to me maybe you don't work (maybe you are too young to work) and it sounds like you still live at home?  You don't suggest estrangement from your mom, so... if you are living at home with your mom, and still close enough with her that you are getting monthly allowance, it does seem pretty 'off' to have blown off her birthday completely in favour of your aunt.  This is what I mean by maybe we are missing some context here, because I feel like there has to be more in your decision making process to get you to the point of making that decision.  Personally even as a young person, I didn't blow off the birthday of anyone I lived with, and I definitely wouldn't have done so to celebrate the birthday of someone I didn't live with, even if they were a loved relative. I appreciate you are close to your aunt, and finances were kinda tight, but I would at worst have gone for a 50/50 split of the funds available between mom and aunt. Yeah that sucks a bit - adulthood is sadly full of expensive months, see parenthood and December - but it just really would not feel right to ignore mom's birthday and buy aunt a gift with money I got from mom.   On reflection, do you think you could maybe have asked dad for an advance on next month's allowance in the circumstances or explained the situation to him? Are mom and dad together? Even if not, is your relationship with your dad okay enough that he would have helped you out of a pretty minor financial embarrassment?  But basically, is there something else going on in your family dynamics that explains your thinking here?",
    "YTA have you heard of budgeting?"

  "selftext": "My dad's sister and my mom were both born on the same day, different years.  My mom and dad, each give me 20 bucks a month for allowance.  This month I used it all on a gift for my aunt's birthday. It's not much money so there was nothing left for my mom.   When she found out she blew up at me. She thinks I should have bought a gift for her instead.  I told her once she gives the money to me, it's mine, and I can do whatever the hell I want with it. What is the point of giving me money if I'm not allowed to use it how I like?  Plus my aunt was my nanny growing up so she is very important to me.",
