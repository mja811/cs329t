    "I'd say NTA given you're already contributing heavily AND they already get an internet discount. BUT YTA for telling them you got the discount. Of course he's going to want it given to the house, that's how selfish people operate. You should kept that info to yourself. Since the cat is out of the bag you have two choices. Say no and deal with the fallout or just move to your own place.",
    "&gt; I said it was closed so I closed it again like any normal person would do  Just FYI, thats an ah way to saythat \"like any normal person would\" sounds like an insult to the asker. It implies your saying they are abnormal for even asking.  To your issue, YTA. If the discount is for electricity, and y'all agreed to share cost of electricity, then the discount goes for all electricity.  \"Your\" electric bill to the company is the full bill. So 30% off the full bill, then the bill sans discount is divided up.",
    "YTA, for being obstinate in not sharing some employer perks for the household that directly benefits all of you.\u00a0 Regarding the rest of the situation, you need to leave the nest, even if it costs more in the short term."

  "NTA": [
    "NTA  but here's the thing... if it's only a \"tiny bit worse off living on \\[your\\] own\" then you need to do this already. move out as soon as you can.",
    "Time for you to keep things to yourself and might be time to find other place to live but NTA you are an adult and you are contributing your part to bills other than that he doesn't need to know your finances.",
    "Time to fly the nest chief.  NTA   Is dad still paying a mortgage?    The porn habit is irrelevant to this story though!!",
    "NTA, you\u2019re already paying a fair share tho, and the discount is a personal work benefit, not household income. Your dad\u2019s reaction sounds controlling, not reasonable. You\u2019re not wrong for wanting to keep what you earn through your job",
    "NTA   The only reason you should increase your household contribution is if costs (rent, groceries, utilities, etc...) have increased, and then the increased cost should be shared equally by everyone.",
    "NTA.  When it comes to splitting expenses, typically roommates split things evenly.  A couple or a family might split them proportionally by income.   You each put \u20ac700 into the account, regardless of your income, like roommates.  This isn't counting the fact that your dad may own the house and so you're getting off cheap.  But there's no reason that you should donate your employee perks while your brother and your dad do not.   Especially since they are getting the benefit of the ISP.   You would be only a \"tiny bit worse off\" on your own, but your dad and brother would be significantly worse off if you moved out.  So you are in a good position to stand firm.",
    "NTA, but I'm thinking it might be time to find a different place to live.  You might pay a bit more, but your mental health might improve not living with a verbally abusive tyrant.    Please do look at how the exact way you phrase things might be more abraisive than need be.  \"The door was closed so I closed it again like any normal person would do\" vs. \"I found the door closed so I re-closed it; if you'd like it open I'll be glad to open it for you\"  (leave out the \"like any normal person would do\" snark).      I mention this not because you are in any way to blame for your Dad's unreasonable behavior, but because living with unreasonable, verbally abusive people tends to warp our own brains and leads us to start reacting in more abraisive, unreasonable ways that then affect our good relationships with nice, normal, not unreasonable people.",
    "NTA if you are getting this money back in your paycheck, that's part of your compensation and not household income, as you are already contributing your share for expenses.",
    "YTA  You get a 30% discount on your electricity bill.  You as a household all pay for the electricity, as you stated.  The discount is for the whole bill, not just a portion.  All the crap about your dad is unnecessary and only for you to drum up sympathy.",
    "You pay the set amount that he and your brother contribute. Why should you pay more? That is ridiculous. Perhaps move out and find a roommate. Your dad sounds unpleasant.",
    "You're not the AH. Maintaining your independence and savings is crucial. If that benefit's yours, keep it. Focus on building your future rather than supporting unhealthy family dynamics.",
    "NTA- Maybe moving out and getting roommates might be a good idea? There are a lot of conflicts with your father and it sounds like you walk on eggshells all the time for little things. You are worried you might set him off, just by being in the house. Moving out would give you a lot of peace and make your life less stressful.",
    "You work from home, so you are using more electricity at your home than if you worked in an office, that is why they give you the discount. Despite the fact you live at home you are incurring more power costs. If you were living anywhere else its likely any flatmates would also expect you to pay more as you using more.",
    "Move TF out. Your dad sounds horrendous and manipulative. He's controlling your finances. WTF are you enabling and paying for your own abuse? You and your bro should get a place together and become entirely financially independent from your father. You can do it. I believe in you.",
    "NTA You and your brother should move out and let your father deal with his lifestyle and his addictions.  Better to be less well-off than to finance his porn use."

    "INFO: I\u2019m not really sure why a 30% discount on electricity is something you\u2019re fighting about. If you get a 30% discount on electricity and pay \u20ac700/month in rent and incidentals, why is there an issue?  It would stand to reason that out of the \u20ac2100/month pot you have, you\u2019d all have a little more for things needed for the household.   Are you supposed to pay more because you\u2019ve been counting the discount on the utilities as part of your monthly contribution, so you\u2019ve actually been putting in less cash?",
    "&gt; Now my dad wants me to deposit the 30% discount I get paid for the electricity discount.\u00a0   I'm not sure I understand this - how can you deposit a discount? Surely the household electricity bill is simply 30% lower than it would be without the discount? In which case everybody would already be benefiting?"

  "selftext": "So our household consists of my dad my brother and me. So I first of all my mom passed away 5 years ago. I am now 21 and my brother is 23 years old.   My dad is known for us as someone you can\u2019t discuss with in any way. For example one time I came home from the train station with my bike. I opened the garage put my bike away and close the garage door. When I came inside my dad suddenly asked angry why I closed the garage door. I said it was closed so I closed it again like any normal person would do. Then he said no it was open and he started shouting. Like why would you should for something small like that. Just open the garage door again if it bothers you that much. (The door was 100% certainly closed.)   Around 5 years ago nearly 2 weeks after my mom passed we also saw that he was paying for fictional p*rn chat sites. This disgusted us and we are now talking in amounts of \u20ac 10.000 so it\u2019s not that it was like \u20ac 5 per month.   So about the main subject. We have a joint account where we each put on \u20ac 700 each month. This is for our monthly expenses like electricity, heating, water, etc. We also use this for things like clothes that everyone needs.   Now my employer gives me a few benefits like 30% discount on my electricity bill. I also have the opportunity to work from home and get a few benefits with that as well. I get \u20ac 75 per month for my internet paid directly to my ISP so everyone benefits from this in our household, I get \u20ac 50 per month just for working from home.   Now my dad wants me to deposit the 30% discount I get paid for the electricity discount. Honestly I don\u2019t want to because I think \u20ac 700 per month is already a lot to pay as rent to your parents to stay home. Now I live in Belgium where the rent is not to bad but you still high and with your monthly expenses I would be a tiny bit worse off living on my own. For the people saying yeah but that\u2019s with your food and everything. Yeah you are all right but I can live a lot cheaper than my dad and my brother.   For that and because the benefit is for me because I work in the electricity sector, I don\u2019t want to deposit this on the joint account.   I am really hard on saving and investing my money for this reason I can really save every \u20ac I can. So do you guys think I am the AH?   Edit: so I see some people asking how the discount works. Well the discount will go on my pay check because they are not the same company as my energy bill company. The Belgian ISP\u2019s have a system where they can use third party payment provider. The energy billing companies don\u2019t have this I think.   Maybe an important thing as well: my brother is not an AH. We have our differences but as a whole he is not a bad person like my dad is.  Some people may think that I just want to talk bad about my dad but everything that I said in here I said for a reason. I\u2019ve been on an Erasmus exchange program in Finland and lived 4 months away from him in peace so I\u2019ve had the chance to think about my situation clearly.   Also some people telling me I should maybe move out and I thought of this many times but I am still 20 y/o and don\u2019t really want to because I live in a strategically good place for work and friends and the area is expensive.   I have also talked to him about this a few moments ago and he agreed that I keep it. The \u20ac 75 per month is plenty for my homework expenses.",
