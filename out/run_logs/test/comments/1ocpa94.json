    "I'm assuming Monica = Mony = Mouni?\u00a0   NTA. It's unfortunate that your father played the favoritism game and had higher expectations for you unfairly. I would stop talking to the other half of the family and the father as they clearly won't stop being toxic anytime soon.",
    "NTA  In some ways your father has done you a favor. You are strong and able to earn your living. Your younger sisters presumably will be, as well.  However your father's spoiling has made the three older ones weak and useless. I wonder who is going to support their idleness once your father is gone.",
    "Honestly I\u2019d tell my father that they didn\u2019t have a mother but you and your younger siblings didn\u2019t have a father because he pretty much abandoned you.",
    "Cut off contact completely. Work on your future and build your life. Don't look back at all when your dad is old and alone and needs a caretaker because his favorite children drop him like a decaying chicken",
    "NTA  \"I'm supposed to feel bad for them getting everything they ever wanted handed to them while me and my actual sisters starved and froze because they didn't have a mother? My real sisters and I didn't have a mother either, or a father, because the two of you were far too busy kissing their asses to remember we existed.  As far as I'm concerned, myself and my actual sisters are orphans. I will not send you money or help you with anything. You will not be at my wedding, you will not meet my children. You are nothing to me. Your daughters are nothing to me. They can cry and pretend like they're sad little victims all they want, but I am done catering to their whims and pretending we have anything in common. We might have grown up in the same house, but we had completely different lives. They had a home and a family that gave them everything. My real sisters and I had nothing and no one but each other, and now? We don't need you. We don't want you. You are nothing, and we will not help you. You'd best hope at least one of your spoiled brats manages to trick someone into marrying her that has money, because we will not be taking care of you in your old age. The only ones you gave a damn about can take on that burden.\"",
    "NTA. Dad needs to fix up. I\u2019m assuming Mouni is Monica?",
    "Wow\u2026 that sounds seriously messy \ud83d\ude2c. Like, you\u2019ve been hustling your whole life, working and helping out, and your sisters just\u2026 got spoiled rotten? Totally makes sense you called it out. Don\u2019t feel bad for being real with them. Just, like, keep standing your ground and don\u2019t get sucked into all their drama too much \u2764\ufe0f.",
    "If you didn't say anything cruel - you told the truth. Some people just can't handle it hearing out.",
    "NTA. You finally made it clear that the two sisters had always gotten preferential treatment. Someone had to tell them.",
    "NTA next time your father calls  \"You have six daughters.  Three got designer dresses, high end clothing, new cars and attended private colleges with no expectations that they contribute to the household.  Three couldn't ask for the price of a soft drink without being guilted, had to wear their clothing until it fell apart, and are expected to start working to pay into the house as soon as they turn eighteen.    Which ones should people feel sorry for?  Because I assure you it isn't your 'sweet motherless children' aka the three leeches being treated like the Kardashians on my dime.  You were so concerned with making things up to those three that you forgot the twins and I existed until we were old enough to fund your guilt trips.  Fix this before you lose half your children over this gross favoritism.\"",
    "Dads the asshole here, love. While sisters likely took advantage, the situation wouldn\u2019t exist without dad."

  "selftext": "I'm from a country that doesn't speak English, and all... I'm writing from a different account, the names are in yours because my family has Reddit.  i'm Eleni, ( 25F) My story began when I was young.  I grew up in a large family, and when I say large, I mean literally large. My mom, dad, three half-sisters from my dad's deceased wife (Sophia, Tia, and Monica), me, my two younger sisters (Noah and Nia, the twins), my unmarried aunt, my two grandmothers, and my paternal grandfather. My large family of 12 members. None of them worked except my dad, mom, and aunt. Our financial situation is rubbish. I always felt that our financial situation would have been great if my dad had stopped spending so much money on his daughters from his first wife.  And when I say a lot of money, it really is. He buys them expensive things.  :- Clothing and Makeup I remember one time he bought Mony a dress for $250, while he refused to give me taxi money. Gifts for no reason.  When I complained to my grandfather about my father, he told me that my sisters didn't have a mother to care for them and that my father wanted to make up for it.  And that when my sisters grew up, they would work and the situation would end.  But that didn't happen because all three of them entered private universities near our house. My father wanted to buy them cars, and of course, our situation got much worse.  Noah and Nia only had two jackets for the winter, which they changed into as spare parts. As time went on, my sisters didn't work.  When I was 17, my father came to prepare me so I could start working at 18, pay rent, and contribute to the household expenses.  The strange thing is that my entire family agreed. I asked my father why his daughters didn't work. He told me I shouldn't compare myself to someone who doesn't have a mother. I told him that  My mother treated them like her own children; she probably pampered them more than we did.  Of course, I worked in a restaurant and at a bookstore. Noah and Nia grew up and went to different universities. Years passed, and I graduated, worked, and helped Noah and Nia.  Two weeks ago, I was at work. Nia called and said she was under my new house and needed someone to open the door for her. I went home, let her in, and we sat down. Suddenly, she told me that her father had kicked her out of the house because she refused to work. (For your information, Nia's field of study is difficult and requires focus, and it's hard for her to work while studying.) Mouni called and asked me to explain her mistake to Nia and let her work and pay her father's rent. I cursed Mouni and told her that she was selfish like her father and that she and her siblings were spoiled in our father's house. Of course, I was met with her famous crying spell.  Everyone called, even Sophie the Charismatic called and asked me how I could upset her sister.  And she thought there was no difference between us.  I told her that the difference between us was very clear",
