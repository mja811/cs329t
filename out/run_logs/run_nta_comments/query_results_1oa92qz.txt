=== QUERY ===
I'm living in an apartment with two roommates, so we're three total. Each of us
have their own room and we share a kitchen and a bathroom. One of my roommates
came back from studying abroad for a year, so he is still often rearranging
stuff in the apartment. I probably should mention that the roommate in question
is neurodivergent with ADHD, so it is difficult for him to follow a regular
schedule.   I sleep very lightly and react very negatively to noise while trying
to sleep. Also I really value going to sleep "early" (earlier than my roommates
that is, anything from 11pm-1am is usual for me) and getting at least eight
hours of it. Because of this I've already had discussions with my roommates a
few times, because they either don't mind noise or go to sleep very late. I've
told them multiple times that it bothers me if they're being noisy at night.  So
in this instance I was trying to sleep at 22:45 when I hear my roommate being
really loud in the hallway, rearranging stuff and turning on the vacuum cleaner
which woke me up instantly. I waited for a few minutes, but when I realized it
would be a longer thing I went out of my room to confront him about it. I tried
to ask nicely if he could try being more quiet and told him that I don't think
it's okay to vaccume this late in the day because I want to sleep and it might
bother the neighbours. He responded that he will try to be more quiet but also
that he will continue vacuuming at some point this night. He told me that this
is the only time he has the chance to do it and he really wants to clean the
place. He insisted that his interest in cleaning up the place is just as legit
as my interest in sleeping, so I should try to be more sympathetic to him.  We
discussed it some more and eventually he did concede to do me a favour, but
still thinks he's in the right. In the end I felt quite bad about it and wonder
if I am ta for stopping my roommates from doing things that are important to
them because of me wanting to go to sleep at a reasonable time.  Edit: for
anyone interested, he still makes noise at night, vacuuming, assembling his
furniture and so on even though I told him I'm not okay with it. He just doesn't
ask me anymore.

Title: AITA for lashing out at my roommate over his constant late-night calls?

I'm gonna lay this out as plainly as possible, the less flattering parts
included, as I am truly split over whether I was in the right for this and would
like frank third-party opinions.     For context, I am a freshman in college
(18M), as is my roommate (18M also). My roommate and I were generally cordial at
first, but he didn't seem particularly social. This is not something that
bothered me -- I don't need my roommate to be my best friend -- but I quickly
discovered he tends to be on calls in the middle of the night. The sleep
schedule of my roommate isn't something that concerns me, nor is it within my
control, but it has become increasingly bothersome as it affects my *own* sleep.
Almost every night, he will leave his lamp on long into the night, playing video
games on call with his friends, not even whispering, and often leaving his phone
on speaker. Most nights, I will go to sleep, drowning out his voice, and will
wake up to another call. Again, it is within his rights to do with his time
whatever he wants, but it bothered me for what I feel llike are obvious reasons.
I will stress again that this is a repeated behavior, not a mere one-time slip-
up.  I will cede that I have probably let this develop into something bigger
than it has to be. I am a non-confrontational person, so I was afraid to address
this even gently; thus, the frustration very much boiled over the last few
months. I doubt he was intentionally trying to upset me, but he did not pick up
on the signs that I was struggling to sleep, even when I covered my head with
pillows, turned off my light, etc. Anyway, last night, at 3 a.m., the
frustration boiled over when I awoke to one of his loud calls, where I snapped,
verbatim, "Dude, I'm trying to sleep. Can you go outside?" On paper, this isn't
really particularly harsh, but my tone definitely leaned on the ruder side, as I
was quite upset and ticked off. I felt immediately bad about it, but am unsure
whether I should apologize or stand my ground. I'm sure he didn't realize the
consequences of his behavior, but it's honestly just felt quite disrespectful.
Some of my friends have said I'm within my right to be upset, some are saying I
should've been more tactful about it, some are saying I should've addressed this
earlier, while others are saying I just have to live with it. I don't want to
have beef with someone with whom I am living, so I was thinking I ought to
apologize, at the very least for my tone of voice. However, I do not want the
late-night calls to continue. So, Reddit, where do you stand?

Tonight my downstairs housemate (28f) texted me (25f) to be quiet because she
could hear me 'doing laps around my room or moving furniture' at 10:40pm.
Problem is, I wasn't doing that.   I tend to go to bed at 11, so at 10:30-45ish
I get ready for bed by putting on my pajamas, walking to the bathroom to brush
my teeth, walking back, doing skincare, generally just being upright and moving
around the room. At most the amount of 'furniture moved' is me opening and
closing the wardrobe door.   Tonight I happened to be listening to a podcast
while I was doing it, so I know for a fact I had only been 'making noise' for
around 12 minutes before she texted me.   Personally I don't think it's
unreasonable to spend 10-15 minutes every night getting ready for bed. I will
also say that this 10-15 minutes is the only time I'm moving around my room at
all in the evening. I spend the entire rest of the time just sat being quiet. I
always listen to music and podcasts with headphones. I can for sure understand
that it must be annoying to hear footsteps when you're trying to sleep but I
personally think that before 11pm is kind of fair game?   Anyway, I replied to
her saying sorry and I genuinely felt really bad about it for a while but the
more I think about it the more I don't think I'm in the wrong? But am I just
really misjudging this and it's totally inappropriate to make noise in a share
house after 10pm? AITA?  Edit: Lots of people are speculating about the floor!
It's carpeted, but the carpet is thin and probably really old so might not be
helping much. Also, I always either wear slippers or socks indoors and tonight
was wearing slippers.

I (26f) moved into a 2b2b apartment in August with a girl (21f). The apartment
was a great deal for the area and we were able to keep out of each other's ways
while still being friendly . Several weeks ago, we went out with a friend of
hers (33M), who she had recently started hanging out/hooking up with. This was
meant to be a night to celebrate an accomplishment of mine, but by the time we
found him (walking on the street with his phone dead at 11 after he left a
concert) he was completely trashed. She spends the night babysitting him while
he was 1) aggressive with guys around us 2) flirted and openly ogled every
person with tits that walked by. I was fine to watch the drama but we went to a
bar where he called a guy a f\*g for not buying me a drink (I am non-binary and
bi). He said this while aggressively stepping up to the guy and getting in his
space. He proceeds to be super rude the whole time. I told her that night I did
not want to hang out with him again A week later I'm woken up at 4am by him
being loud in the kitchen talking to my roommate. I had to text her to quiet
down, then come out of my room to say it again because he didn't stop. they
moved to her room where they got in a screaming match in front of her two
friends who were with her. It turns out he had spent the night flirting with the
girl they were with and repeatedly told her to "show \[him\] her tits." He was
also drunk and aggressive and she kicked him out. He then forgot his backpack
and knocked and rang our doorbell at 4:45am multiple times since she didn't take
his calls. After all of this, I told her I did not want him coming over and she
said it was fine bc he was blocked. Last week, who sleeps over but this guy. I
always hear them when he comes in at night bc he is so loud. I told her again
even if she wants to be friends with him, I don't want him in the house. I
explained to her that I have anxiety and ptsd and his behavior has made me
uncomfortable with him to the point where I don't want him here, especially when
I am asleep because it spikes my anxiety and makes me feel unsafe. She thinks
this is not a fair restriction of me to ask of her. Her arguments are basically
1) both of us should be allowed to do whatever we want in our rooms so long as
it doesn't affect the other one and since this only affects me bc of my
issues/feelings, its not fair to make her change her behavior. 2) (in response
to me suggesting that he only sleep over 1 or maybe 2 nights a week if its
really that important to her or limit it to weekends) that she does not schedule
her plans like that and its not reasonable to change that for me. She argued
that she's not a child and can do what she wants and roommates can't set rules
for each other or dictate what the other does. 3) He's a good guy and I'm just
judging him on two bad nights and should talk to him to get over my issues. I
really think I'm being reasonable, but I'm not sure what to do. Would love
thoughts on why I'm wrong or right.

I 20F and my roommate 20F live in a house with two other girls. They have their
own bedrooms, but we share one. Our beds are about a foot apart and we have
canopies so it's a little more private.   My roommate is a very heavy sleeper.
Her alarms are really loud, and go off frequently every morning. This isn't
usually a problem because we almost always wake up at the same time or me before
her, but very occasionally she wakes up at an odd time to do homework before
class. Today it was 4am.   For contrast, I'm a light sleeper and I have a hard
time falling back asleep sometimes. We do have a small suite in the basement
with a bed and bathroom, and its own heating. WIBTA if I asked my roommate to
sleep down there whenever she needs to wake up in the middle of the night?
EDIT: I forgot to mention that the suite needs to stay open for guests, so I
can't move there permanently. I love my roommate and she is usually very
considerate, so I definitely don't want to cause an argument! I think the best
course of action would be to ask her to warn me so I can go sleep down there,
which I'm happy to do. Hopefully she will remember.  EDIT 2: im sorry to those
who assumed I want her to move down there permanently. I am happy to go down
there myself, and it's only like once or twice a month when she has to set early
alarms. It wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that she doesn't wake up so
they go off every five minutes for an hour.

This morning my boyfriend and I were sleeping at my place, a shared apartment.
At 6AM we get woken up by my roommate who came home from clubbing (this roommate
has been living with us for 2 months). She came home with 3 other people and
they were being very loud (laughing hysterically, screaming, slamming doors). I
texted our group chat and ironically asked if they could be any louder. I got no
reply and they didn’t turn the volume down. I get up and scream at my roommate
to turn it down because everyone is trying to sleep. She laughs in my face and
says they will do so. But they didn’t. I fell asleep for a little bit when i
woke up at 7AM because of loud noises. I turn to my boyfriend and we both
realize what they are doing. Her friend and a guy were having fun in the kitchen
and my roommate and a guy had fun in her room. We immediately turn on some music
so we don’t have to hear them. My boyfriend went up to go to the toilet and the
kitchen door was wide open. After that they all went into the roommate’s room.
We thought it was over so we turned the music off. After a few minutes i get up
to go to the toilet and they were going at it again (once again very loudly).
I’ve had enough and banged on her door and yelled at her and kicked the 2 guys
out. I was mad and screamed at her asking what’s going on with her and how she
thinks that that is okay. She just laughed in my face hysterically. I told her
to clean the whole kitchen which she’s only done after i told her 5 times. She
told me that she didn’t get why i was so mad and what she did wrong. AITA?
