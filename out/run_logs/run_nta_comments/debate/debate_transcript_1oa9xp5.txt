--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: My bf &amp; I recently moved in
together&amp; are having a bonfire tn with a few of his friends. His ex roommate
has been dating this girl on&amp;off the past year or so. Ive had minimal
interactions w her but everytime ive seen her in person she says nothing to me
unless I say hi first then shell say hi. Shes told my bfs roommate from the get
go that shes worried he wants to date me&amp;that im flirting w him. Both my
bf&amp; his room mate know this isnt true. My bf and I have a really good
relationship&amp; theres never been attraction or flirtation between me&amp;his
room mate or any1 else for that matter  Room mates gf has messaged me several
times on fb telling me she knows im attracted to her bf &amp; that I exclude her
by not saying hi when I see her(shes referencing a time when she didnt hear me
say hi&amp; found it rude). She doesnt believe me or my bf when we tell her im
not attracted to her bf. She also asked me to stop talking to her bf &amp; i
told her im not going to ignore him when im at my bfs house &amp; his rm-mate
starts talking to both of us.   She even snooped so far back on my fb &amp;
found a post I shared 10 or so years ago &amp; sent it to her bf w no context,
asking him if he liked it&amp;when he said yeah she told him i had posted it(It
wasnt even my original post, i just shared smthing). Her mssges&amp;stalking my
fb were so anxiety inducing at one point I blocked her. She then found me on
insta&amp;sent me a message telling me i was petty for blocking her,which I
didnt even notice until she screen shot it, sent it to my bf&amp;then blocked
him I unblocked her cause I felt bad and to explain why id blocked her in the
first place Also she wont say a single thing to me in person &amp;ive invited
her to hang w us several times but she never comes  Recently she &amp;her bf
broke up. Its happened a couple times &amp; im not super close w my bfs rm-mate
so I didnt think much of it until she sent me a message on fb telling me they
broke up&amp; asking me if I could find him someone else to date. This is like
within a week of them breaking up. I found this really weird and it made me even
more anxious. I responded by telling her my bf, who was still living w him,
could check on him&amp; left it at that  That brings us to the present. my bf
moved in last week &amp; we invited his ex room mate over for this bon fire. I
didnt think the gf would be a problem bc they arent 2gether but today he asked
if she could come with. my bf &amp; I both said no. He said this made her sad
&amp; he might not come  I really dont want her at my hosue. Shes made me so
anxious &amp; it honestly makes me feel crazy that she even asked to come w
after everything My bf is more chill abt her coming over but hes also supportive
of me not wanting to see her  AITA? Should I let her come over? I feel bad that
my bfs friend isnt gonna come now &amp; im worried shes gonna isolate him from
his friends esp if hes living alone now

Opposing side:

The original poster is the asshole because she is allowing her personal feelings
and anxieties about the girlfriend to dictate the social dynamics of her
boyfriend's friendships. By insisting that the girlfriend not be invited, she is
prioritizing her discomfort over the potential for a healthy social interaction
and connection, which could help ease tensions. It reflects a lack of empathy
and maturity to deny someone a chance to participate in a gathering simply
because of past issues that aren't directly related to the current situation.
Instead of fostering a more inclusive environment, she is choosing to isolate
someone who may not even pose a threat, thus harming her boyfriend's friendships
and overall social life.

While I understand the concerns raised, the argument that the original poster
(OP) is at fault overlooks important context regarding her feelings and the
dynamics at play.   First, it's crucial to recognize that the OP's discomfort
stems from a legitimate concern for her relationship, based on past experiences
that may have caused her anxiety. It’s not merely about personal feelings; it’s
about setting boundaries for her emotional well-being. Relationships often
require establishing boundaries to protect oneself from situations that could
lead to distress, especially if the girlfriend has a history that negatively
impacts the OP.  Additionally, here’s a new argument: The OP is entitled to
voice her feelings and preferences regarding social gatherings involving her
partner. Healthy relationships thrive on communication and transparency. By
expressing her discomfort, the OP is advocating for her needs. Her partner
should respect her feelings and work collaboratively to find a solution that
honors their relationship. This doesn’t make her at fault; rather, it shows she
values her emotional health and the integrity of their relationship.

Moderator Summary: In the debate, key arguments for YTA revolve around the
notion that the original poster (OP) is prioritizing her personal feelings over
her boyfriend’s friendships. Critics argue that by insisting the girlfriend not
be invited, she is fostering exclusion rather than allowing for potential
reconciliation and healthy social interaction. They emphasize a lack of empathy
and maturity in denying someone a chance to be part of the gathering based on
past issues that may not necessarily predict current behavior.  On the other
hand, the NTA arguments assert that the OP's discomfort is rooted in legitimate
concerns for her emotional well-being, given past experiences with the
girlfriend. They highlight the importance of setting boundaries in
relationships, with the OP advocating for her needs and ensuring her emotional
health is prioritized. The argument stresses that effective communication and
mutual respect are essential in healthy relationships, and the OP's desire to
protect her emotional space does not make her at fault.  Ultimately, the NTA
arguments are stronger, as they focus on the importance of emotional well-being,
boundary setting, and the right to express discomfort in social dynamics. The
YTA perspective, while highlighting the need for empathy, fails to address the
OP's legitimate concerns regarding her relationship and mental health.  Winner:
