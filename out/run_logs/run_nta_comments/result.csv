1oad7wt,AITA for telling my mom her boyfriend isn't welcome to events anymore?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oad7wt/aita_for_telling_my_mom_her_boyfriend_isnt/,NTA,NTA,True,"I, (28F) have recently told my mother her I will no longer be going out to see her at her home, where she and her boyfriend, let's call him Fred, live, and he is no longer welcome to come here under any circumstance. For context, my mom lives about an hour away, and with work schedules and all, we don't see each other too often to start. Now, she and ""Fred"", have been together for about 6 years, and have lived together for about 5, and she made the move out of town to be with him. Since myself and my younger brother were already grown and out of the house already, and she has been seeing him for a year already, they were making plans to move in together, but since his kids were younger, I believe 18 and 16 at the time, it made sense for her to move out there. We were all fond of Fred when she had introduced him, and after her long history with abusive relationships, he seemed like a great change, and we were happy for her. My mom, relocating, didn't know anyone out there other than Fred and his family, and since relocating had to start a new job. Everything seemed fine until fast forward a year or so when his behavior started to change. He is constantly accusing her of cheating (despite never doing so), always questioning her whereabouts, and even makes comments about her weight. So over the years, I would get phone calls of her crying, and saying how she can't do it anymore. Her being my mother, I always tried to help, and even offered for her to stay with me and my family until she found something for herself. But, he'd apologize , and all was forgiven. This has happened about a dozen times in the last 5 years, and always she forgives him, and everything is all dandy again.  Now, fast forward to a few weeks ago. I got one of these phone calls, again, and so did my brother. This time seemed like it was it. So myself, brother, sister in-law and my husband were making plans to get her out and to set her up back here in our town. But low and behold, two days later, he apologized and everything was forgiven, again. So my brother and I had said enough was enough, and if she was ever serious about leaving, we will 100% be there for her, and she is always welcome here to visit, but is no longer welcome, since we cannot pretend to fake nice to a man who treats our mother like garbage. I also have two young children who have started to ask why he says mean things to their grandma, and said I don't want her to model that type of relationship to them. But she has sense said I'm being, quote ""immature, mean, and that is uncalled for since he's 'trying"""", and is telling other family members I'm trying to cut her out, when I have said she is still always welcome. AITA for saying he cannot come anymore? Or should I just bare it for the sake of not losing my mother and the relationship with her grandkids?",,"The original poster is the YTA because they are attempting to control their mother's relationship choices instead of supporting her autonomy. While it is understandable to be concerned about their mother's well-being, outright banning her boyfriend from family events is disrespectful and dismissive of her feelings and decisions. This approach risks alienating their mother and potentially pushing her closer to Fred, as it may create a perception that her children do not respect her choices. Instead of imposing restrictions, the OP should focus on open communication, providing emotional support, and encouraging her mother to recognize the unhealthy dynamics in her relationship without severing ties or creating ultimatums.

Refuting the last YTA argument, I would argue that the original poster's concerns are rooted in genuine care for their mother's well-being, especially if there is a history of negative behavior from the boyfriend that could impact the family. The OP is not trying to control their mother’s choices but rather protect her from potential harm. Their actions stem from a place of love and concern, which is valid when a loved one is involved with someone who may not have their best interests at heart.

Additionally, a new concise argument for the author not being at fault is that setting boundaries in family relationships is crucial for maintaining a healthy dynamic. If the OP believes that their mother's boyfriend poses a risk to her emotional or physical safety, it is their responsibility to advocate for her well-being. By expressing concern and establishing limits, the OP is taking a proactive stance to safeguard their mother, which is a commendable and necessary action in the face of potential harm.The original poster is at fault because they are trying to control their mother's personal choices rather than supporting her autonomy. While their concerns for her well-being may stem from love, the approach of banning her boyfriend from family events is disrespectful and dismissive of her feelings. This kind of control can alienate the mother and push her closer to the boyfriend, as it may create a perception that her children do not trust her judgment. Instead of imposing restrictions, the OP should focus on fostering open communication and encouraging their mother to reflect on her relationship, allowing her to make her own decisions without feeling cornered or judged.

Refuting the last NTA argument, it is important to recognize that while the OP's intentions may be rooted in concern, the execution of those intentions is flawed. Setting boundaries is vital, but it must be done in a way that respects the mother's agency. By issuing ultimatums or attempting to dictate who she can associate with, the OP risks damaging their relationship with her, which can have long-term negative consequences. A healthier approach would involve expressing concerns while allowing their mother the space to make her own choices, fostering trust and understanding rather than conflict.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it is crucial to understand that the original poster's actions stem from a place of deep concern for their mother’s well-being. The OP is not merely attempting to control their mother's choices; they are advocating for her safety and emotional health, especially if there are legitimate concerns about the boyfriend's behavior or intentions. The OP's protective instincts are valid, particularly when a loved one may be involved with someone who could have a negative influence. It's important to prioritize the mother's welfare, and expressing concern and setting boundaries can be essential in ensuring she is not harmed.

Additionally, a new concise argument for the author not being at fault is that every family has the right to establish boundaries regarding who is welcome in their lives, especially when there are concerns about a family member’s partner. The OP is exercising their right to protect their family environment by expressing discomfort with the boyfriend's presence at family events. It is reasonable for the OP to want to create a safe and supportive atmosphere for their mother, and setting boundaries is a necessary step in maintaining that safety. Ultimately, advocating for a loved one’s well-being does not equate to controlling them; it reflects a commitment to their health and happiness.The original poster is at fault because they are attempting to control their mother's personal life rather than respecting her autonomy and decision-making abilities. While concerns about a partner are valid, the OP's approach—banning the boyfriend from family events—creates a hostile environment and risks alienating their mother. By imposing such restrictions, the OP may inadvertently push her closer to the boyfriend, as it could foster a sense of rebellion or defensiveness. Instead of dictating who she can associate with, the OP should focus on cultivating open dialogue that allows their mother to feel supported in evaluating her relationship without feeling judged or coerced.

Refuting the last NTA argument, it is essential to recognize that establishing boundaries in relationships should not come at the cost of respect for the other person's choices. While the OP's intentions may be to protect their mother, the method employed is counterproductive. Effective communication and expressing concerns in a respectful manner would be far more beneficial than issuing ultimatums. By taking a controlling stance, the OP risks damaging their relationship with their mother and failing to foster an environment where she feels safe to share her thoughts and feelings about her partner. Ultimately, the OP should prioritize their mother's emotional autonomy while still expressing their concerns, rather than attempting to dictate her choices.

The original poster is not at fault because their actions stem from a genuine concern for their mother's well-being. If the OP believes that the boyfriend poses a threat to their mother's emotional or physical safety, it is entirely reasonable to express that concern. Advocating for a loved one’s safety is a sign of caring, and the OP’s desire to protect their mother from a potentially harmful relationship should be viewed as a responsible and loving action. 

Refuting the last YTA argument, it is important to recognize that while autonomy is crucial, it should not come at the expense of safety. If the boyfriend has exhibited troubling behavior, the OP’s proactive stance is warranted. Rather than simply allowing their mother to make decisions that could lead to harm, the OP is taking a stand to protect her welfare. Open communication about boundaries, rather than outright bans, can still convey concern without undermining her autonomy. The OP’s intentions are rooted in love and care, making them not at fault for wanting to safeguard their mother’s happiness and health.The original poster is at fault because they are overstepping boundaries and attempting to control their mother's personal life instead of supporting her autonomy.

This method risks creating conflict within the family and might push the mother closer to the boyfriend, as it suggests that her children do not trust her judgment. Instead, the OP should focus on fostering open communication and understanding, encouraging their mother to make her own informed choices without feeling coerced.

Refuting the last NTA argument, it’s important to recognize that the OP’s actions, while well-intentioned, come off as controlling rather than protective. Setting boundaries is a valid concern, but it must respect the mother's agency. By issuing ultimatums, the OP risks damaging their relationship with her and creating an environment of distrust. A healthier approach would involve expressing their concerns while allowing her the space to navigate her relationship independently. Advocating for a loved one’s well-being is important, but it should be done in a way that empowers them rather than seeks to limit their choices.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it is essential to recognize that autonomy should not come at the expense of safety. While the mother has the right to make her own choices, the OP's role as a caring family member includes voicing legitimate concerns about a partner's behavior. Instead of simply allowing the mother to make decisions that could lead to harm, the OP is taking a proactive stance by trying to create a safer and healthier family environment. Open communication about these concerns can lead to a better understanding, and the OP’s intentions are ultimately about safeguarding their mother, which is a commendable motive.The original poster is at fault because they are prioritizing their own feelings and judgments over their mother's autonomy and emotional needs. While expressing concern for a loved one is important, outright banning her boyfriend from family events is an overreach that disrespects her ability to make her own choices. This controlling behavior can create resentment and push the mother away, potentially strengthening her bond with the boyfriend instead of weakening it. The OP should strive for open communication, allowing their mother to feel heard and supported in her decisions, rather than imposing restrictions that can lead to further conflict.

Refuting the last NTA argument, while the OP's intention to protect their mother is commendable, the execution of that intention is flawed. Setting boundaries is essential, but it should be done in a way that respects the mother's dignity and agency. By issuing ultimatums, the OP risks damaging their relationship with her and fostering an environment of distrust. A more constructive approach would involve discussing concerns openly and encouraging the mother to reflect on her relationship without resorting to controlling tactics. Ultimately, the OP's actions could backfire, leading to the very outcome they wish to avoid: a deeper attachment between the mother and the boyfriend due to feelings of rebellion or defensiveness.

The original poster is not at fault because their actions stem from a genuine concern for their mother's well-being. If there are valid reasons to believe that the mother's boyfriend poses a risk—be it emotional, physical, or otherwise—it is reasonable for the OP to advocate for her safety. Expressing concern about a potentially harmful relationship demonstrates care and responsibility, and it is essential for family members to look out for one another.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s crucial to recognize that while autonomy is important, it should not come at the expense of safety.

**YTA (You're the A**hole) Arguments:**

1. The OP's actions are rooted in genuine concern for the mother's well-being, especially if the boyfriend poses a risk to her emotional or physical safety.

Both sides present strong arguments, but the NTA perspective emphasizes the importance of safety and genuine concern for a loved one’s well-being. The YTA arguments focus on the autonomy and emotional respect of the mother, but they may overlook the potential risks associated with the boyfriend's behavior.

1o8lauo,AITA if I drop off a note and baked goods to my neighbor who made me pick up somebody else’s dog poop?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o8lauo/aita_if_i_drop_off_a_note_and_baked_goods_to_my/,YTA,NTA,False,"My SO (M33) and I (F32) moved into a new area. I’m careful about my dog going potty on lawns, I ALWAYS pick it up and bring extra bags. Tonight on our walk, our dog went potty immediately. Picked it up and looped around back towards our house from the other direction. Close to home he sniffed another dogs poo and we kept going.   We’re at our door when I hear somebody running up behind startling us. A guy is coming at us with “Your dog pooped on my lawn and you need to pick it up”. I say calmly, “I know for a fact that didn’t happen, you’ve got the wrong dog”. He insists it JUST HAPPENED, he saw it, and has it on camera. I say, “Let’s see the footage because I’m POSITIVE”. My SO didn’t want it to escalate so he says, “Let’s go take a look”. Neighbor puts his hand on my SO’s back and pushes him towards his house. They are of similar cultural background so maybe ok but I didn't like it. I look down and see I have our bag in my hand and yell ahead to them. They didn’t hear me or my SO didn’t want me to get involved. I take a breath, drop off the dog, and head back. If by some miracle my dog had gone without me noticing I would apologize and pick it up.   Neighbor shows me over to where it is and points to the poo in question, I shine my light and I can’t help but literally start laughing out loud. Every oz of diplomacy failed at that moment. It was white, dry, hard as a rock, and TINY. Obviously been sitting there for a long time and where I saw my dog smelling it. I said incredulously, *“*That’s not my dog’s poop, can’t you see how hard it is? It’s old”. He answers, “I’m not here to argue with you-just pick it up.” Now, I’m pissed. I know my SO hates when I argue with people, but I have a strong respect complex. I look this man dead in the face as I scoop it up and say, “Funny how you don’t want to ‘argue’ but you want to make me pick up somebody else’s DOG SHIT. Where’s the camera footage? Would love to see it”. Then my SO hurries me away towards home.  He tells me we should be the bigger people and reminds me there’s so many bigger things in life. Says he also laughed, told him it was super old and also made it clear we didn’t do it. Told him “you must be having a hard time with this issue if you’re having to literally run after people. I’m sorry this happens to you so much”. SO doesn’t let things like that get to him and always feels bad for the out of line person. I often feel the need to correct them. In the grand scheme of things it’s just a piece of poo. But the principle is what gets me. Now here’s where I might be an ahole: I’m considering baking him treats and dropping them with a note like “I’m the bigger person we got off on the wrong foot but you’re still totally wrong and I’m not the one”. My SO thinks it isn’t necessary, and we should ignore him. I’m not trying to start anything bigger but I’m also not a doormat. So Reddit, AITA if I drop off a note and baked goods to my neighbor who made me pick up somebody else’s dog poop?",,"The original poster is the asshole because instead of taking the opportunity to resolve the misunderstanding calmly and maturely, they chose to escalate the situation by arguing with the neighbor and then considering passive-aggressive behavior by dropping off baked goods with a snarky note. This approach fosters animosity and does not contribute to a positive community relationship. Instead of embodying the ""bigger person,"" they risk creating further conflict, which is not conducive to neighborly harmony.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that conflict resolution is not solely the responsibility of one party. The original poster may have acted in a way that seemed confrontational, but if the neighbor initiated the misunderstanding or displayed passive-aggressive behavior first, it’s reasonable for the OP to respond in a manner that reflects their feelings of frustration. It’s essential to consider the context of the interaction; the OP may have felt provoked and reacted accordingly.

Additionally, a new argument in favor of the original poster is that they were attempting to communicate their feelings and concerns about the situation, which is a healthy step in addressing conflict. Rather than ignoring the issue, they chose to engage with the neighbor, showing a willingness to resolve the problem. This proactive approach demonstrates maturity and a desire for understanding, rather than avoidance or escalation. The OP is not at fault for wanting to express their perspective in a challenging situation.The original poster is at fault because they chose to escalate the situation rather than seek a constructive resolution. Instead of addressing the misunderstanding directly with their neighbor in a calm and respectful manner, they resorted to passive-aggressive behavior, such as dropping off baked goods with a snarky note. This approach not only perpetuates negativity but also undermines the opportunity for a positive conversation that could have clarified the misunderstanding. 

In contrast to the notion that their actions were justified, it's crucial to emphasize that effective communication is key in any community relationship. By failing to engage in a straightforward dialogue, the OP is contributing to a cycle of hostility rather than fostering a sense of neighborly goodwill. Instead of being the bigger person, they opted for a route that can only serve to further alienate them from their neighbor, demonstrating a lack of accountability for their contribution to the conflict.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s essential to highlight that the original poster's intention was not to escalate the situation but to express their feelings and address a misunderstanding. While the neighbor may have initiated the passive-aggressive behavior, the OP’s response can be seen as a way of confronting the issue rather than avoiding it. They were attempting to communicate their discomfort, which is a valid and necessary step in resolving conflicts, especially when feeling wronged.

A new argument supporting the original poster is that their actions can be interpreted as a form of self-expression rather than malice. The OP was likely trying to convey their feelings in a more light-hearted manner by baking goods, which is often seen as a gesture of goodwill. This approach indicates a desire to mend fences rather than create further division. Therefore, the OP’s actions reflect a creative attempt to address the issue while still maintaining a sense of community, showing that they are not at fault.The original poster is at fault because their choice to respond with passive-aggressive behavior, such as dropping off baked goods with a snarky note, demonstrates a lack of maturity and accountability. Instead of addressing the misunderstanding directly with their neighbor in a constructive manner, they opted for a sarcastic approach that is likely to escalate tensions rather than resolve them. 

Additionally, a new argument for the OP being at fault is that their actions could contribute to a toxic environment within the neighborhood. By engaging in passive-aggressive behavior, they set a precedent for conflict rather than cooperation. A true resolution requires open communication and a willingness to understand the other party's perspective, neither of which were present in their actions. The OP missed an opportunity to foster goodwill and strengthen neighborly relations, ultimately making them the one in the wrong.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster's actions were driven by a desire to address a misunderstanding, not to escalate conflict. The OP's choice to engage with the neighbor—albeit in a light-hearted manner—indicates an attempt to communicate their feelings rather than to create animosity. While the delivery might have lacked tact, the intention behind it was likely to foster dialogue rather than perpetuate negativity.

A new argument supporting the original poster is that they were acting within a context of frustration and hurt feelings, which is a natural human response. When faced with passive-aggressive behavior, it’s reasonable for someone to feel compelled to respond in kind, especially if they believe their feelings were dismissed or misunderstood. By expressing their emotions through baked goods, the OP was trying to find a way to bridge the gap and initiate a conversation. This shows a level of emotional awareness and a desire to resolve the issue, rather than simply retaliating or ignoring the problem. Thus, the OP should not be faulted for their approach, as it reflects a genuine effort to connect and clarify the situation.The original poster is at fault because their choice to respond with passive-aggressive behavior, such as dropping off baked goods with a snarky note, demonstrates a lack of maturity and accountability.

While the choice to use baked goods as a medium for communication might not be conventional, it reflects an attempt to address the issue creatively rather than through outright confrontation. The OP’s actions can be seen as a way to express their feelings in a less aggressive manner, indicating a desire to engage rather than escalate.

Moreover, a new argument supporting the original poster is that they were trying to diffuse a tense situation with humor and light-heartedness. By baking and delivering goods, the OP was not only attempting to address their feelings but also to lighten the mood surrounding the conflict. This approach shows an effort to turn a potentially hostile interaction into a friendly one, demonstrating that they are not at fault for seeking a resolution in a way that aligns with their personality. Engaging in a light-hearted manner can often be more effective in building community than a straightforward confrontation, which the OP's actions reflect.The original poster is at fault because their decision to respond with passive-aggressive behavior, such as dropping off baked goods with a snarky note, indicates an unwillingness to engage in direct and honest communication with their neighbor. Rather than addressing the misunderstanding openly, they chose a route that can escalate tensions and foster resentment, which is counterproductive to building a positive community relationship.

Furthermore, a new argument for the OP being at fault is that their actions reflect an immaturity that can undermine neighborly trust. Instead of seeking to clarify the misunderstanding through dialogue, they opted for a sarcastic gesture, which could easily be misinterpreted or cause further conflict. This lack of clear communication not only affects their relationship with the neighbor but also sets a poor example for handling disputes in a community. By not taking responsibility for their feelings and addressing the issue directly, the OP missed an opportunity to promote understanding and cooperation, ultimately placing them in the wrong.

For the sake of privacy i will reference them as club 1,2,3 and 4 and they are not ranked based on skill or anything like that. Im not the best by any means, infact i think of myself as the worst one there, but i have experience playing for all of them other than club 1.  Now onto the story. So finnaly after one year of being the newest member of club 2, someone else decided to join. This got me excited, and after practice was over i went over to him and decided to be a good teammate and talk to him so he feels welcomed into the club. We met in the lobby after we got dressed from practice and talked a decent bit. I decided to tell him how i got my first golden medal. I told him that even though i play for club 2, on the yearly/grand tournament my coach decided to let the other teams borrow me for 2 reasons: i was the newest one there, being the least of value; and the other clubs where missing players. To be specific, team 3 which was a mixed club (men and women) was missing a goalkeeper, and also the rest of the club wasn't that sharp either as i was faster than all of them during warmups, and team 4 which litteraly had HALF of their players borrowed from either club 1 or 2. Due to these reasons i told him that here there are basically 2 good clubs, club 1 and 2, and that the others suck. (Now even though i barely played for my team, i still won gold because my team won gold, but i dont think this is relevant to the story)  Well as it turns out the coach for team 4 happened to be in the lobby, and when he heard what i said he got defensive and told us that thier club will be good, and that i was playing against thier underaged players.  I feel bad that he heard that, and of course no body wants to hear bas stuff about themselves or something they've poured time into and also because i played for them in the tournament, but i feel like what i said was only the truth as yes, they do suck in comparison to club 1 and 2, while also furhter proving my point as due to the fact that they needed to borrow players in the first olace meant they weren't good enough to compete in the first olace. Also i think that i said nothing wrong - only the trith that happens to be cold and harsh. It wasnt directed as an insult, but only the truth so the new teammate could get a better understanding of the competition.  So am i the asshole?",,"Yes, you are the asshole. While you may believe that your comments were based on truth, they were disrespectful and dismissive of the hard work and dedication of the players from club 3 and club 4. Bad-mouthing other teams, especially in front of a new teammate and their coach, creates a toxic environment and undermines the spirit of sportsmanship. It's important to support and encourage all athletes, regardless of their club's performance, rather than belittling them. Your words could discourage the new player and foster animosity instead of camaraderie.

While I understand the concern about fostering a supportive environment, it's important to recognize that constructive criticism can play a role in healthy competition. The original poster was not at fault because their comments were likely intended to provide context about the competitive landscape, rather than to belittle the players from clubs 3 and 4. In sports, discussing strengths and weaknesses is a common practice, and it can help new teammates understand where they might need to focus their efforts. Instead of creating a toxic environment, the poster was attempting to set realistic expectations and encourage a mindset geared towards improvement and growth.

Additionally, by being honest about the competition, the original poster may have inadvertently motivated the new player to strive for excellence, fostering a more determined and resilient attitude. This approach can ultimately benefit the team as a whole, as it encourages everyone to push their limits and aspire to greater achievements.While the previous arguments highlight the importance of honest discussions in sports, they fail to consider the impact of the delivery and context of those comments. The author is at fault for their approach because it was dismissive and undermined the efforts of players from clubs 3 and 4. Acknowledging the strengths and weaknesses of competitors can be done in a respectful manner without resorting to negative remarks that may discourage others.

Furthermore, the author’s comments could easily create a divisive atmosphere rather than a supportive one. By focusing on disparaging remarks about other teams, they risk alienating not just the new teammate but also fostering a culture of negativity within the team. Encouraging a healthy competitive spirit should involve uplifting all players, regardless of their current skill level, and promoting teamwork rather than tearing down others. The author should have approached the conversation with more empathy and consideration for the broader impact of their words.

While I understand the concern about the author's approach, it is crucial to recognize that the intent behind their comments was likely to provide context and motivate the new player. The author is not at fault because they were attempting to convey the competitive reality of the teams involved, which can be valuable information for someone new to the environment. 

Moreover, competitive sports naturally involve discussions about strengths and weaknesses, and it's important to frame these conversations in a way that encourages growth rather than discouragement. The author’s remarks could be viewed as a way to set realistic expectations, helping the new teammate understand what they might face and how to prepare for it. Instead of fostering division, this kind of honesty can promote a stronger sense of teamwork as everyone strives to improve collectively.

In summary, the author's goal was likely to clarify the competitive landscape, not to belittle others, and this intent should be recognized in evaluating their actions.The author is at fault because their comments were not only dismissive but also fostered a negative atmosphere that undermines sportsmanship and teamwork. While discussing competition is essential, the manner in which the author chose to express their thoughts was detrimental. Instead of fostering a supportive environment for the new teammate, they opted to criticize other players, which can discourage collaboration and camaraderie.

Additionally, by focusing on the inadequacies of clubs 3 and 4, the author risks creating a culture of elitism within their team. This not only alienates potential allies but can also demoralize players who may be striving to improve. Constructive feedback can be delivered in a way that uplifts rather than degrades, and the author missed an opportunity to encourage a more inclusive and positive team dynamic. In competitive sports, it’s crucial to balance honesty with respect, and the author’s failure to do so makes them at fault in this situation.

While previous arguments have focused on the tone of the author's comments, it's important to recognize that the author is not at fault, as their remarks were made in an effort to provide context and prepare the new teammate for the competitive environment. The intent behind their comments was likely to foster awareness of the challenges ahead, which can be beneficial for someone new to the team.

Additionally, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of competitors is a common practice in sports and can be framed as an opportunity for growth. By sharing insights about the competition, the author aimed to motivate the new player to strive for improvement. Instead of creating a negative atmosphere, the author's intention was to encourage resilience and determination, which are crucial attributes in competitive sports.

Ultimately, the author's comments were not meant to belittle other teams but to set realistic expectations and promote a mindset geared towards improvement. This perspective emphasizes the importance of understanding the competitive landscape while still supporting all players, regardless of their current skill level.The author is at fault because their comments crossed the line from constructive feedback into outright disparagement of other teams, which can significantly harm team cohesion and morale. While discussing competition is a necessary aspect of sports, the way the author chose to express their thoughts was dismissive and disrespectful. 

By openly criticizing players from clubs 3 and 4, the author not only risks discouraging the new teammate but also sets a poor example of sportsmanship. It’s essential to foster an environment where all players feel valued and supported, regardless of their current skill level. Disparaging remarks can create a culture of elitism and negativity, which ultimately detracts from the team's overall unity and success. 

Moreover, the author could have framed their insights in a more encouraging manner, highlighting areas for improvement while respecting the efforts of all players. This approach would have promoted a more positive atmosphere and fostered a sense of teamwork rather than division. Overall, the author's failure to balance honesty with respect makes them at fault in this situation.

The author is not at fault because their comments were likely intended to provide context and help the new teammate understand the competitive landscape. In competitive sports, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of teams is a common practice, and it can serve as a valuable learning opportunity for newcomers. 

Additionally, the author’s remarks may have been aimed at motivating the new player to strive for improvement and set realistic expectations. Rather than belittling others, the intent could be interpreted as a way to encourage resilience and determination, which are essential qualities in sports. 

It's also important to consider the competitive nature of the environment; honesty about the level of competition can foster a drive for excellence among teammates. By being forthright, the author was not necessarily creating a negative atmosphere but rather preparing the new teammate to face challenges head-on. Thus, the author's approach, while perhaps blunt, was ultimately intended to promote growth and awareness, making them not at fault in this context.The author is at fault because their comments, intended or not, foster a negative and disrespectful atmosphere that undermines the core values of sportsmanship. Instead of offering constructive insights, the author chose to belittle the players from clubs 3 and 4, which can discourage not only the new teammate but also create a divide within the team. 

By openly criticizing other teams rather than focusing on their own team’s strengths and areas for improvement, the author risks alienating players who may feel demotivated by such remarks. In sports, it’s crucial to build each other up and create a culture of support, rather than tearing others down. The author could have framed their observations in a way that emphasized teamwork, collaboration, and mutual respect, which are essential for fostering a positive environment.

Ultimately, the author’s failure to communicate their thoughts in a respectful and encouraging manner makes them at fault in this situation, as it detracts from the team's overall cohesion and morale.

The author is not at fault because their intention appears to be rooted in providing honest feedback about the competitive landscape, which can be essential for a new member. In competitive environments, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of opposing teams can be vital for preparation and growth. The author likely aimed to set realistic expectations for the new teammate, which can motivate them to improve and adapt.

Additionally, competitive sports inherently involve discussions about performance. By addressing the challenges posed by other teams, the author may have been trying to foster a mindset of resilience and determination. This approach can ultimately encourage the new player to rise to the occasion and strive for excellence, rather than creating a negative atmosphere.

It's also essential to note that being open about competition does not equate to disrespect. The author could have framed their comments as a way to encourage teamwork and improvement, helping the new player understand that every team has its own journey.

1o8l5d7,AITA for not wanting to pay my opiate addict mom 400 dollars rent?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o8l5d7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_my_opiate_addict_mom/,YTA,NTA,False,"I’m 20 years old and my mom has been an addict for as long as i can remember. When i turned 18 she lost 1000 dollars a month from her social security so it was a big change. I finally have a part time job and make about 400 dollars each check (give or take bcz i don’t have a set amount of hours.) My mom is demanding half of every check and i don’t want to give it to her as she is an opioid addict. And quite frankly has never been good with money. She already spends my 160 that i get on my food card every month by ordering name brand groceries and so much meat and fruit that goes to waste.   On top of that my friend who lives with us also pays her rent. My mom never asked for me to pay rent until 1. she got her other pain meds cut off and 2. when my friend moved in and started paying her rent.   My mom also went bankrupt for the second time a few months ago. She is already talking about getting a loan for a car while her license is also suspended. I don’t feel comfy paying a drug addict that i know very well half of my pay check.   I get that she is in pain and has back issues and surgeries coming up and  she really does want to get clean but im tired of seeing no progress and trusting her word. Not even two days latter my friend gave her 400 she was coming to me saying she had no money for cigs or umo fare.   She gets mad when i talk about moving and saying why would i want to pay rent somewhere else and it’s gonna be more. I know it will be more but giving the living situation i am in current, it’s not worth a dime.   On top of it all i found out that i am pregnant so i really can’t be living here and like this nor am i gonna be giving her money that i will need more than ever to someone who doesn’t know how to budget and is just gonna spend it on drugs. Every morning day and night i have to check on her making sure shes not folded like a lawn chair. I can’t take care of a kid and her.   Edit: In no way do I plan on staying here for very long especially if she doesn’t start taking big steps very soon. My bf really wants to be here for me and step up and get better job so we can get our own place. I am gonna ask my boss to move up to full time so I can better prepare for my next steps aswell. I know i am not responsible but I never needed to be before and I am gonna do everything I can to make this life worth living for me and my kid.   And tbh all i am seeing in the comments is stuff that i am fundamentally aware of, so it’s more so just solidifying stuff i already know and will need to do. So everyone telling me this is a bad situation and that i am irresponsible. I KNOW THAT, that is why things need to change and I want to change them FAST.   At this point it’s not even about the rent money or if i am the asshole. i just wanted to hear everything i already know so i don’t feel like im just abandoning her for no reason. It’s so unfair that i am the one that was left with this, so proud of my sibling for getting out but god this just sucks all around.   I’ll be sure to update yall when i make it out✌️",,"While it's understandable that the original poster feels overwhelmed by their situation, they are ultimately responsible for their own decisions and must recognize that their mother is still their family. Refusing to help her with rent, even in the context of her addiction, can be seen as abandoning her in a time of need, especially when they have the means to contribute. Supporting a family member through difficult times, despite their flaws, is part of familial responsibility, and the poster should consider the impact of their choices on their mother's well-being.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to consider the complexity of familial relationships, particularly when addiction is involved. The original poster is not at fault for prioritizing their own well-being and boundaries. They may have experienced emotional or financial strain due to their mother's addiction, and it's crucial for them to protect themselves from further harm. Supporting someone with an addiction can sometimes enable destructive behavior rather than foster recovery.

Additionally, a new argument for the author not being at fault is that the original poster has the right to set boundaries for their mental and emotional health. It’s essential to recognize that enabling a family member’s addiction by providing financial support can perpetuate the cycle of dependency and neglect their own needs. By choosing not to contribute to their mother’s rent, the poster is making a conscious decision to avoid enabling behaviors that could harm both themselves and their mother in the long run. Prioritizing personal health is not only valid but necessary for sustainable support in the future.Refuting the last NTA argument, it's essential to acknowledge that while setting personal boundaries is crucial, completely cutting off support can have devastating effects on a family's dynamics, especially when addiction is involved. By refusing to help their mother with rent, the original poster may be exacerbating the situation, leading to further instability for their mother, which could negatively impact their relationship and the mother's ability to seek recovery. Family support can be a catalyst for change, and by withdrawing it entirely, the poster risks deepening the cycle of addiction and despair.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that they are failing to consider the long-term implications of their decision on their family and themselves. While it’s understandable to protect one’s own mental health, the poster's refusal to assist their mother could lead to increased resentment and guilt in the future. It’s important to balance self-care with the responsibilities of family, and outright refusal to help in a time of need may result in lasting damage to their relationship. Instead of abandoning their mother, the poster could explore alternative ways to offer support that don’t compromise their boundaries, such as encouraging her to seek help for her addiction while still providing some level of financial assistance.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's crucial to understand that while familial responsibility is important, the original poster's decision to prioritize their own well-being is not only valid but necessary. Supporting a family member with an addiction can often lead to enabling harmful behaviors rather than fostering recovery. The poster has the right to protect their mental and emotional health, especially if previous interactions have been damaging. They are not responsible for their mother's choices, and setting boundaries is a critical step in preventing further harm to themselves.

A new argument for the author not being at fault is that the original poster may have already provided support in the past, and consistent financial aid could contribute to a cycle of dependency rather than recovery. By choosing not to help with the rent, the poster is making a conscious decision to encourage their mother to seek professional help rather than relying on them for financial stability. This approach promotes accountability for the mother’s actions and encourages her to take steps toward recovery, which ultimately benefits both parties in the long run. It’s not about abandoning family; it’s about fostering an environment where both can pursue healthier paths.Refuting the last NTA argument, while it's true that setting boundaries is essential for personal well-being, the original poster's refusal to help their mother with rent may overlook the potential for compassion and constructive support. By completely withdrawing assistance, they risk pushing their mother further into despair, which can exacerbate her addiction rather than encourage recovery. Family dynamics can be complex, and sometimes offering help in a controlled manner—such as contributing to treatment rather than direct financial aid—can foster healthier relationships and promote recovery.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that they may be missing an opportunity for a constructive dialogue with their mother. By refusing to help outright, the poster is not only closing the door on potential support but also on any chance for their mother to acknowledge her struggles and seek help. Instead of a blanket refusal, the poster could have approached the situation by discussing their concerns and exploring alternatives together, ultimately fostering a healthier relationship and encouraging their mother to take responsibility for her life. This approach would demonstrate both care and accountability, rather than creating an emotional divide.

Refuting the last YTA argument, while it’s important to recognize the need for boundaries, it’s also crucial to consider that outright refusal to assist a struggling family member can sometimes lead to unintended consequences. The original poster may not be seeing the potential for a balanced approach that includes both self-care and compassion. By cutting off support entirely, they risk alienating their mother further, which could hinder her recovery and create additional emotional distance between them. Offering support in a way that encourages accountability—such as helping her find treatment or contributing only to her recovery efforts—could foster a more positive outcome for both parties.

A new argument for the author not being at fault is that the original poster has likely already faced significant emotional and mental strain due to their mother’s addiction. It’s possible that they have already tried to help in various ways without seeing positive results, leading to a justified sense of frustration and fatigue. Recognizing the limits of what one can do for another, especially in cases of addiction, is not selfish; it’s a necessary step to avoid enabling harmful behaviors. Prioritizing their own well-being does not equate to abandoning their mother but rather reflects a healthy understanding of their role in the relationship. They deserve to protect their mental health while still seeking to support their family in healthier, more sustainable ways.Refuting the last NTA argument, while the importance of protecting one's mental health is undeniable, it is equally critical to recognize that completely withdrawing support can have severe repercussions for a loved one struggling with addiction. The original poster's decision to not help their mother may reflect a lack of understanding of the complicated nature of addiction, where sometimes, even limited support can act as a lifeline. By refusing to offer any assistance, the poster risks further isolating their mother, potentially pushing her deeper into her addiction and making recovery harder to achieve. A more nuanced approach that combines boundary-setting with some form of support could help foster recovery and maintain familial bonds.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that they are failing to explore alternative forms of support that do not compromise their boundaries but still demonstrate care for their mother's well-being. Instead of a blanket refusal to help with rent, the original poster could consider finding ways to assist their mother in seeking treatment or exploring financial resources available for those struggling with addiction. This would allow them to maintain their boundaries while still being involved in their mother’s recovery process. The original poster's lack of willingness to engage in a constructive conversation about how to support their mother may lead to guilt and resentment down the line, ultimately damaging their relationship further.

Refuting the last YTA argument, while setting boundaries is indeed vital for personal well-being, completely withdrawing support can often lead to unintended harm, particularly in situations involving addiction. The original poster's refusal to assist their mother may exacerbate her situation, pushing her further into despair and potentially worsening her addiction. A more balanced approach could involve setting conditions for support, such as encouraging her to seek treatment or providing assistance specifically for recovery-related expenses. This would allow the poster to maintain their boundaries while still contributing positively to their mother’s situation.

A new argument for the author not being at fault is that they might have already exhausted their resources—both emotional and financial—trying to help their mother in the past. It’s possible that previous attempts to support her have led to frustration and disappointment, leaving them feeling helpless. In this context, choosing to prioritize their own mental health by refraining from further financial assistance is a rational decision. They have the right to step back and reassess their role in the relationship, recognizing that they cannot be responsible for their mother’s choices or recovery. Ultimately, it’s not about abandoning family but about finding a healthier way to navigate a complex and painful situation.Refuting the last NTA argument, while it is true that the original poster has the right to protect their mental health, it’s important to consider that completely withdrawing support may not be the most effective way to foster positive change in their mother's life. This approach can enhance feelings of isolation and despair for the mother, potentially worsening her addiction. Instead, a more constructive response would involve engaging in dialogue to explore how the poster might help while still maintaining their boundaries, such as directing support towards treatment options rather than simply cutting off all assistance.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that they may be missing an opportunity to model healthy behavior and responsibility. By refusing to help their mother, the original poster could inadvertently reinforce a cycle of neglect and avoidance rather than encouraging accountability. Navigating a loved one’s addiction is undeniably challenging, but engaging in tough conversations about responsibility and support can open pathways to recovery. The poster’s refusal to help might close the door on potential healing for both themselves and their mother, leading to greater long-term consequences for their relationship. Finding a way to support while still prioritizing personal health could ultimately foster a healthier dynamic and contribute to their mother's recovery.

Refuting the last NTA argument, while it’s understandable that the original poster wants to protect their mental health, completely withdrawing support can inadvertently lead to further damage in their mother’s life. This approach risks deepening the cycle of addiction, as isolation and lack of support can exacerbate negative behaviors. Instead of cutting off all assistance, the poster could consider a more balanced approach, such as setting clear boundaries while still offering some form of support that encourages their mother to seek help, thus promoting accountability.

A new argument for the author not being at fault is that the original poster may have already experienced significant emotional toll from past attempts to help their mother. If they have repeatedly offered support only to see it lead to further harm, their decision to step back could be a necessary act of self-preservation. It’s important to recognize that the poster is not responsible for their mother’s choices or recovery; prioritizing their own well-being is a legitimate response to a difficult situation. By refraining from financial assistance, they are asserting the need for their mother to take responsibility for her own life, which is a crucial step in breaking the cycle of enabling behaviors.","{'score': 3, 'criteria': 'The response exhibits some grounding but contains unsupported claims that reduce its overall reliability.', 'supporting_evidence': 'While it discusses personal responsibility and the complexities of familial relationships involving addiction, the explanation could have included specific facts or expert viewpoints to strengthen its credibility.'}","**Summary of Arguments:**

**YTA (You're the Asshole) Arguments:**
1. The original poster (OP) should help their mother since family responsibility involves supporting one another, especially in times of need.
2. Refusing to assist could be seen as abandoning the mother during a vulnerable period, which may negatively affect their relationship.
3. The OP's actions could lead to feelings of guilt and resentment later on, as they may regret not providing help when it was needed.
4. Exploring alternative forms of support would show care and could foster a healthier relationship rather than creating emotional distance.

**NTA (Not the Asshole) Arguments:**
1. The OP has the right to prioritize their own mental and emotional health, especially if previous attempts to help have been damaging.
2. Supporting someone with an addiction can enable harmful behaviors; thus, it's important to avoid contributing to dependency.
3. Setting boundaries is essential for personal well-being, and the OP should not feel guilty for stepping back from providing financial support.
4. The OP may have already provided extensive support in the past and needs to reassess their role to maintain their own health and well-being.
5. Refusing to help could encourage the mother to seek professional help rather than relying on the OP for financial stability.

**Determination of the Winner:**
While both sides present compelling arguments, the NTA side effectively highlights the importance of personal boundaries and the potential harm of enabling addictive behaviors. The OP’s need to protect their mental health and the validity of reassessing their role are strong points. Additionally, it emphasizes that support should not come at the cost of one’s well-being. The YTA arguments, while emphasizing familial responsibility, do not adequately address the complex dynamics of addiction and the potential negative consequences of enabling behaviors.

1oacydb,AITA for not spending time with my mum?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oacydb/aita_for_not_spending_time_with_my_mum/,NTA,NTA,True,"I F21 still live at home with both of my parents and my adult brother. A reoccurring argument my mother and I have is that I don’t “hang out” with her as much as she’d like. Saying this, when we are both at home we don’t have issue being in one another’s space, walking our dogs together, cooking together or doing activities together (jigsaw puzzles, art etc) Today she asked me to join her and watch a local boat race and I declined. She then didn’t go because she didn’t want to go alone, and expressed frustration and an annoyance over my constant reluctance to hang out with her and now there is obvious tension between use. She makes me feel like I owe her more of my time. I’d understand if I lived out of home and we didn’t see each other every day, but I don’t believe I deserve to be guilt tripped into spending time with my mother, am I the asshole?",,"The original poster is the asshole because, while it's understandable to want personal space, she is disregarding her mother's feelings and desire for connection. Relationships, especially with family, require effort and compromise. By consistently declining invitations and not valuing her mother's attempts to spend quality time together, she is contributing to the tension in their relationship and failing to show appreciation for her mother's efforts to bond. A little more willingness to participate in these activities could strengthen their relationship and alleviate her mother's feelings of loneliness and disappointment.

While the previous YTA argument highlights the importance of family connections, it overlooks the original poster's autonomy and the need for personal boundaries. The poster has every right to prioritize her own mental well-being and comfort, which is not inherently selfish or dismissive of her mother's feelings. Relationships thrive on mutual respect, and if the original poster feels overwhelmed by constant invitations, it is reasonable for her to establish limits to protect her emotional health. Additionally, it’s essential for family members to communicate openly; if the mother truly desires a relationship, she should respect her daughter's boundaries and seek to understand her perspective rather than imposing her own expectations.

**New Argument:**
The original poster is not at fault because she is actively communicating her needs and boundaries to her mother. By expressing her desire for personal space, she is fostering a healthier dynamic that encourages both individuals to respect each other's feelings. Compromise is essential in relationships, but it must be mutual; her mother should also recognize and respect her daughter's need for autonomy instead of viewing it as rejection. This approach ultimately promotes a more respectful and balanced relationship between them.The original poster is at fault because, while she may feel the need for personal space, she is failing to consider the impact of her actions on her mother. The mother’s repeated invitations are not just casual requests; they are expressions of love and a desire to connect, especially if the mother is feeling lonely. By continuously rejecting these overtures, the poster is effectively shutting down her mother's attempts to engage, which can lead to feelings of rejection and sadness. 

**New Argument:**
The original poster is at fault because her refusal to participate in family activities can come across as dismissive or ungrateful. Rather than just asserting her need for space, she could find a compromise that allows for occasional participation in her mother’s invitations. Engaging in family activities, even if it's not her favorite thing to do, demonstrates care and appreciation for her mother’s efforts. By refusing to compromise, she risks damaging their relationship and missing opportunities for connection that could enrich both their lives.

The previous YTA argument emphasizes the importance of family connections, but it misses the crucial point that personal boundaries are essential for maintaining healthy relationships. The original poster is not at fault because she is prioritizing her own mental well-being, which is necessary for any relationship to thrive. It is important for individuals to communicate their needs, and by asserting her desire for personal space, the poster is taking a responsible step in ensuring that her interactions with her mother are grounded in mutual respect rather than obligation.

**New Argument:**
The original poster is not at fault because she has the right to set boundaries that protect her emotional health. While her mother’s invitations may stem from a place of love, the poster’s need for space does not diminish that love. Healthy relationships require both parties to understand and respect each other’s boundaries. By expressing her needs, the poster is fostering an environment where both she and her mother can engage in a more meaningful and respectful relationship, rather than one based on guilt or obligation.The original poster is at fault because she is not sufficiently recognizing the emotional needs of her mother, who is reaching out for connection. While personal boundaries are important, the poster's repeated refusals to engage in family activities can be perceived as dismissive, potentially deepening her mother's feelings of loneliness and rejection. 

**New Argument:**
The original poster is at fault because she is failing to find a balance between her need for personal space and her mother's desire for connection. Family members deserve to feel valued and appreciated, and by consistently declining invitations, the poster risks alienating her mother. Engaging in family activities, even occasionally, is a fundamental part of nurturing relationships. The poster should consider that her willingness to participate, even minimally, could foster a positive relationship dynamic and show her mother that she values her efforts to maintain a connection. Ignoring this aspect can lead to misunderstandings and resentment, ultimately harming their relationship.

The previous YTA argument correctly emphasizes the importance of family connections but overlooks the original poster's right to prioritize her own well-being. The original poster is not at fault because she is establishing necessary boundaries that help her maintain her mental health. While it’s important to foster connections, it’s equally vital for individuals to honor their own needs. The poster's repeated refusals do not signify a lack of love or care; rather, they reflect her desire for personal space, which is essential for sustaining healthy relationships.

**New Argument:**
The original poster is not at fault because she is actively communicating her boundaries, which is crucial for a healthy relationship. By expressing her need for personal space, she is fostering an environment where both she and her mother can engage in a more respectful and understanding manner. It's important for family members to respect each other's needs, and the poster’s willingness to communicate her preferences should be seen as a step towards building a stronger relationship, rather than as a rejection of her mother’s love and intentions.The original poster is at fault because she is not fully considering the emotional impact of her actions on her mother. While personal space is important, consistently rejecting invitations can be perceived as a lack of appreciation for her mother's efforts to connect. The mother may be seeking companionship out of love and concern, especially if she is feeling lonely. 

**New Argument:**
The original poster is at fault because she is not making an effort to compromise or find a middle ground in her relationship with her mother. While it is perfectly valid to need personal time, she could choose to participate in family activities occasionally to show her mother that she values her attempts to bond. This small gesture can significantly strengthen their relationship and help her mother feel loved and appreciated. By refusing to engage even a little, the original poster risks alienating her mother and deepening feelings of isolation, which is counterproductive to fostering a close family relationship.

The previous YTA argument emphasizes the importance of family connections but fails to recognize that the original poster is not at fault for prioritizing her own mental health and personal boundaries. While family relationships are important, they should not come at the expense of individual well-being. The poster has a right to assert her needs, and it’s crucial for family members to respect those boundaries instead of expecting constant engagement.

**New Argument:**
The original poster is not at fault because she is taking proactive steps to communicate her needs, which is essential for a healthy relationship. By expressing her desire for personal space, she is encouraging her mother to understand and respect her boundaries. It is important for family dynamics to be based on mutual understanding rather than obligation. By setting these boundaries, the poster is not only protecting her own mental health but also inviting her mother to engage in a more meaningful and respectful way. This can ultimately lead to a more balanced and fulfilling relationship for both of them.The original poster is at fault because she is failing to acknowledge the emotional needs of her mother, who is reaching out for connection. Although the poster may feel the need for personal space, consistently declining invitations can be perceived as a rejection of her mother's love and attempts to bond, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and hurt for her mother.

**New Argument:**
The original poster is at fault because she is missing an opportunity to strengthen her relationship with her mother by not finding a compromise. While it is completely valid to need personal time, participating in family activities occasionally can show her mother that she values their relationship. This small act of engagement can foster connection and understanding, demonstrating that she appreciates her mother's efforts to reach out. By refusing to participate at all, the poster risks alienating her mother and deepening feelings of isolation, which is detrimental to both their emotional well-being. Finding a balance between personal space and family connection is crucial for maintaining a healthy relationship.

The previous YTA argument correctly emphasizes the emotional impact that the original poster's actions may have on her mother, but it fails to acknowledge the importance of personal boundaries for maintaining a healthy relationship. The original poster is not at fault for prioritizing her own mental health and well-being. It’s essential for individuals to communicate their needs, and by asserting her desire for personal space, the poster is actually promoting a healthier dynamic in their relationship.

**New Argument:**
The original poster is not at fault because she is taking an important step in self-advocacy by establishing her boundaries. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect, and by communicating her need for personal time, she is encouraging her mother to understand and respect her feelings. Rather than viewing this as a rejection, the mother could see it as an opportunity to foster a relationship that honors both parties’ needs. By prioritizing her own well-being, the original poster is setting a precedent for a more balanced and respectful relationship, which can ultimately lead to deeper connections in the long run.","{'score': 3, 'criteria': 'Some grounding but with a few unsupported claims.', 'supporting_evidence': 'The response provides valid points about the importance of both personal space and family connections, but it ultimately lacks concrete citations or factual grounding; it reflects subjective opinions that may or may not resonate universally.'}","**Summary of Arguments:**

**YTA (You're the Asshole) Arguments:**
1. The original poster (OP) is disregarding her mother's feelings and the desire for connection, which is important for family relationships.
2. Consistently declining invitations from her mother can lead to feelings of rejection and sadness for her mother, who is expressing love through her invitations.
3. OP's refusal to engage in family activities may come across as dismissive or ungrateful, risking damage to their relationship.
4. A balance needs to be found where OP occasionally participates to show appreciation for her mother’s efforts, which could enrich both their lives.
5. Ignoring the emotional impact of her actions could deepen her mother's loneliness and feelings of isolation.

**NTA (Not the Asshole) Arguments:**
1. OP has the right to prioritize her mental well-being and establish personal boundaries without being viewed as dismissive of her mother's feelings.
2. By actively communicating her needs, OP is fostering a healthier dynamic that encourages mutual respect.
3. Compromise must be mutual; OP's mother should understand and respect her daughter's need for autonomy rather than impose expectations.
4. Setting boundaries can lead to a more meaningful relationship based on understanding rather than obligation.
5. Prioritizing personal space can ultimately lead to a more balanced relationship, allowing for deeper connections in the long run.

**Conclusion:**
The debate highlights the need for both personal boundaries and family connections. While the YTA arguments emphasize the emotional impact of declining invitations on the mother, the NTA arguments defend the right of the original poster to maintain her mental health through boundaries. The NTA arguments present a case for mutual respect and understanding in relationships, suggesting that prioritizing personal well-being can enhance family dynamics in the long run.

This is to avoid the hassle of putting them out in the morning or risk missing them being collected in case the binmen come early.   We forgot to put the bin out until I remembered at about 11pm. I brought our bin out and went back in. Bin got collected. Happy days.  My neighbour came up to me and got angry at me because I brought the bin out too late and that it was too noisy when they were trying to sleep. I apologised several times for this and told them that it won't happen again, but they just kept giving out about it and then walked back into their house without accepting it or even acknowledging it.  I went back inside, explained what happened to my fiancee. They think that:  1. They are being unreasonable telling us when we can and can't take our bin out. 2. That they were rude to walk away from me without acknowledging my apology. 3. That if they didn't want to hear outside noises that they shouldn't keep their bedroom windows open (they keep their bedroom window open every night)  I'll be more considerate about this going forward, either making sure to bring the bin out earlier or carrying the bin to the collection point so as to avoid the wheels making any noise, but them getting angry about it to me has taken me back a bit, and I feel like she doesn't like us anymore.  Just wondering what you guys think?",,"YTA because, while you may have had a valid reason for taking the bin out late, you did so at a time when most people are trying to sleep. Consideration for your neighbors' peace is essential in a community. The noise from wheeling out a bin late at night can be disruptive, and it's important to respect the shared living environment. Apologizing was a good first step, but it's also crucial to recognize that your actions, although unintentional, impacted someone else's comfort. Taking the time to be more mindful of when you put your bin out demonstrates respect for your neighbors.

While I understand the concerns raised about noise and disruption during late hours, it's important to recognize that the original poster had a reasonable and perhaps unavoidable situation that led to their actions. Life can be unpredictable, and sometimes tasks need to be completed without consideration for the clock. 

**Concise Argument for the Author Not Being at Fault:** The original poster was likely managing a pressing personal situation, which warranted their late-night action. It’s essential to acknowledge that everyone has their own challenges, and sometimes circumstances dictate our actions. The poster should not be faulted for prioritizing their needs, especially when they were unaware of the potential disturbance. A community thrives on understanding and empathy, rather than strict adherence to noise norms at all times.YTA because, while you may have had a valid reason for taking the bin out late, you did so at a time when most people are trying to sleep.

**New Argument for the Author Being at Fault:** The author failed to consider alternative options, such as waiting until the morning to take out the bin or finding a quieter method to do so. A little foresight and planning could have prevented the situation entirely. This indicates a lack of responsibility and awareness of how their actions affect others in their community.

My bf and I have a really good relationship&amp; theres never been attraction or flirtation between me&amp;his room mate or any1 else for that matter  Room mates gf has messaged me several times on fb telling me she knows im attracted to her bf &amp; that I exclude her by not saying hi when I see her(shes referencing a time when she didnt hear me say hi&amp; found it rude). She doesnt believe me or my bf when we tell her im not attracted to her bf. She also asked me to stop talking to her bf &amp; i told her im not going to ignore him when im at my bfs house &amp; his rm-mate starts talking to both of us.   She even snooped so far back on my fb &amp; found a post I shared 10 or so years ago &amp; sent it to her bf w no context, asking him if he liked it&amp;when he said yeah she told him i had posted it(It wasnt even my original post, i just shared smthing).

Should I let her come over? I feel bad that my bfs friend isnt gonna come now &amp; im worried shes gonna isolate him from his friends esp if hes living alone now",,"The original poster is the asshole because she is allowing her personal feelings and anxieties about the girlfriend to dictate the social dynamics of her boyfriend's friendships. By insisting that the girlfriend not be invited, she is prioritizing her discomfort over the potential for a healthy social interaction and connection, which could help ease tensions. It reflects a lack of empathy and maturity to deny someone a chance to participate in a gathering simply because of past issues that aren't directly related to the current situation. Instead of fostering a more inclusive environment, she is choosing to isolate someone who may not even pose a threat, thus harming her boyfriend's friendships and overall social life.

While I understand the concerns raised, the argument that the original poster (OP) is at fault overlooks important context regarding her feelings and the dynamics at play. 

First, it's crucial to recognize that the OP's discomfort stems from a legitimate concern for her relationship, based on past experiences that may have caused her anxiety. It’s not merely about personal feelings; it’s about setting boundaries for her emotional well-being. Relationships often require establishing boundaries to protect oneself from situations that could lead to distress, especially if the girlfriend has a history that negatively impacts the OP.

Additionally, here’s a new argument: The OP is entitled to voice her feelings and preferences regarding social gatherings involving her partner. Healthy relationships thrive on communication and transparency. By expressing her discomfort, the OP is advocating for her needs. Her partner should respect her feelings and work collaboratively to find a solution that honors their relationship. This doesn’t make her at fault; rather, it shows she values her emotional health and the integrity of their relationship.While I understand the concerns raised, the argument that the original poster (OP) is at fault overlooks important context regarding her feelings and the dynamics at play.

Additionally, here’s a new argument: The OP has every right to express her feelings and preferences regarding social gatherings involving her partner. Healthy relationships thrive on open communication and mutual respect. By voicing her discomfort, the OP is advocating for her needs and ensuring that her emotional health is prioritized. Her partner should respect her feelings and work collaboratively to find a solution that honors their relationship. This does not make her at fault; rather, it demonstrates her commitment to maintaining a healthy dynamic.

In conclusion, the OP's concerns are valid, and her desire to protect her emotional space is a crucial aspect of any relationship.While I understand the concerns raised, the argument that the original poster (OP) is at fault overlooks crucial context regarding her feelings and the dynamics at play.

Critics argue that by insisting the girlfriend not be invited, she is fostering exclusion rather than allowing for potential reconciliation and healthy social interaction. They emphasize a lack of empathy and maturity in denying someone a chance to be part of the gathering based on past issues that may not necessarily predict current behavior.

On the other hand, the NTA arguments assert that the OP's discomfort is rooted in legitimate concerns for her emotional well-being, given past experiences with the girlfriend. They highlight the importance of setting boundaries in relationships, with the OP advocating for her needs and ensuring her emotional health is prioritized. The argument stresses that effective communication and mutual respect are essential in healthy relationships, and the OP's desire to protect her emotional space does not make her at fault.

Ultimately, the NTA arguments are stronger, as they focus on the importance of emotional well-being, boundary setting, and the right to express discomfort in social dynamics.

1oa90yg,AITA for making my sick mom cook,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa90yg/aita_for_making_my_sick_mom_cook/,YTA,NTA,False,"My mom is upset with me for not wanting to help cook a dinner that I was invited to. I hate cooking, but my mom seems to think I need to help her cook.  Some details that matter: 1) the kitchen is tiny, and there are 4 people in there now 2) my step dad micro manages everything that happens in the kitchen 3) I was invited to eat dinner, not cook it 4) even though my mom is sick and says she cant stand for very long, she is one of the 4 people in the kitchen 5) I dont enjoy cooking  So AITA for making my sick mom cook?  Obviously I forgot some info, only 3 of the 4 are cooking, my step dad is micro managing, my mom is not contagious, she is just having some womanly issues that are causing cramping. My mom will not sit down, she has to be forced down, and there is only room in the kitchen for 2 people to cook comfortably. And I was holding the baby  I find myself commenting this a lot, so im going to put it up here... I would NEVER invite someone over for dinner and expect them to cook it. That is ridiculous. There is a difference between offering to help and being told to help. Also if my mom knew she was going to tell me to help, she should have said that when she invited me. I would have gladly helped if she had said ""the plan is to go pick up dinner stuff, make it together and then eat"" but when she made the plans she said ""we will go get dinner and spend some time together""",,"The original poster is at fault because, regardless of their dislike for cooking, they should recognize that their sick mother is trying to contribute to the family gathering despite her discomfort. Instead of prioritizing their own preferences, the OP could have shown compassion and offered to help alleviate their mother's burden, especially since there are limited resources in the kitchen. Family dynamics often require flexibility and support, and refusing to assist when someone is struggling can come off as selfish and unsupportive.

In response to the last YTA argument, it's important to consider the context of the OP's situation. While it's true that the OP's mother is unwell and trying to contribute, the OP's feelings about cooking stem from a genuine dislike and perhaps even a lack of skill. Forcing someone to cook against their will doesn't necessarily show compassion; it can lead to resentment and further stress, which wouldn't be beneficial for anyone involved, especially a sick family member.

A new argument supporting the OP is that their refusal to cook can actually foster a healthier family dynamic. By setting boundaries and clearly communicating their limitations, the OP encourages open dialogue about responsibilities within the family. This approach promotes understanding and collaboration, rather than guilt and obligation. Ultimately, it's important for family members to respect each other's preferences and strengths, and the OP's decision to not cook respects their own boundaries while also potentially prompting a more equitable distribution of tasks among family members.In response to the last NTA argument, it's important to acknowledge that while the OP's dislike for cooking is valid, the situation involves more than just personal preference. Family gatherings often require compromises and sacrifices for the greater good, especially when a family member is unwell. The OP could have taken a moment to reflect on their mother's efforts to contribute despite her illness and recognize that supporting her in this instance might have been more beneficial for the family's emotional well-being.

A new argument for the OP being at fault is that they missed an opportunity to model empathy and responsibility. By refusing to cook, the OP not only contributed to their mother's stress but also set a precedent that it's acceptable to prioritize one's own discomfort over family obligations. This behavior can lead to a lack of cohesion within the family and discourage others from stepping up in times of need. The OP could have shown leadership by helping their mother, reinforcing the idea that family members support each other, especially during challenging times.

In response to the last YTA argument, it's crucial to recognize that while family gatherings often require compromise, the OP's feelings about cooking should not be dismissed. The OP's dislike for cooking is not merely a personal preference; it can stem from anxiety, past negative experiences, or a lack of skill. Forcing someone to participate in an activity they dread can lead to resentment and doesn't necessarily reflect empathy or support. The OP's boundaries are important, and respecting those boundaries can foster a healthier family dynamic in the long run.

A new argument for the OP being not at fault is that they may be protecting their own mental health by refraining from cooking. If the OP has had negative experiences or significant stress related to cooking, stepping back can help prevent feelings of overwhelm, which could ultimately affect their interactions with family members during the gathering. By prioritizing their well-being, the OP may actually be in a better position to engage positively with their family. Supporting one's own mental health can lead to more constructive family dynamics and ultimately benefit the entire group.In response to the last NTA argument, while it's true that the OP may have personal reasons for disliking cooking, it doesn't absolve them of their responsibility to contribute to the family during a gathering, especially when a family member is unwell. Family events are about coming together and supporting one another, and refusing to help in a time of need can be seen as a lack of solidarity. The OP's personal feelings should not overshadow the collective needs of the family, particularly when their mother is already struggling.

A new argument for the OP being at fault is that their refusal to cook could create a sense of division within the family. By not stepping up to help, the OP sets a precedent that it's acceptable to prioritize personal preferences over familial responsibilities. This can lead to feelings of resentment among family members who are willing to make sacrifices for one another. In a family setting, it's essential to foster a spirit of cooperation and support, and the OP's unwillingness to engage in a shared responsibility undermines that spirit. Ultimately, the OP's actions could negatively impact family cohesion, making it crucial for them to reassess their role in these gatherings.

In response to the last YTA argument, while it's valid to highlight the importance of family support, it overlooks the OP's right to establish personal boundaries. Everyone has different comfort levels when it comes to certain tasks, and the OP's dislike for cooking may stem from valid reasons, such as anxiety or past negative experiences. Forcing someone to cook when they are uncomfortable can lead to resentment, and ultimately, a less pleasant atmosphere for everyone involved during the gathering.

A new argument for the OP not being at fault is that they demonstrated self-awareness by recognizing their limitations and choosing not to engage in cooking. By declining to cook, the OP may encourage other family members to step up and contribute, fostering a more collaborative environment. This approach promotes a sense of shared responsibility and can lead to a more equitable distribution of tasks within the family. In this way, the OP's decision not only respects their own boundaries but can also empower others to contribute, ultimately enhancing the family's overall dynamic.In response to the last NTA argument, while it's important for individuals to recognize and respect their own boundaries, the OP's refusal to help in a family setting where a member is unwell can come off as inconsiderate. Family gatherings are often about coming together to support one another, and the OP's insistence on avoiding cooking can be seen as prioritizing their own discomfort over the needs of a sick family member. This refusal can create an atmosphere of discord rather than unity, which is essential during challenging times.

A new argument for the OP being at fault is that their actions demonstrate a lack of empathy and support in a vulnerable moment for their mother. By not stepping in to help, the OP could inadvertently reinforce a pattern of behavior where family members feel unsupported during difficult times. In families, especially when someone is ill, it's vital to show solidarity and care through actions. The OP's unwillingness to assist may lead to feelings of isolation for their mother, further exacerbating her situation. Engaging in family responsibilities, even when uncomfortable, can strengthen bonds and foster a sense of community that is crucial during tough times.

In response to the last YTA argument, while it’s important to consider family dynamics, it’s equally vital to recognize that everyone has their own limits and comfort zones. The OP’s dislike for cooking may stem from genuine feelings of anxiety or inadequacy in the kitchen, and forcing them to cook could lead to a negative experience that affects not only their mood but also how they interact with family during the gathering. The OP's decision to refrain from cooking can be seen as a healthy boundary that ultimately preserves their mental well-being.

A new argument for the OP not being at fault is that their refusal to cook may encourage a more equitable distribution of responsibilities among family members. By not taking on the cooking task, the OP may inadvertently prompt others to step up and contribute, fostering collaboration and shared effort within the family. This can lead to a healthier family dynamic where everyone feels responsible for the gathering, rather than placing the burden on a single individual. In this way, the OP’s choice not only respects their own boundaries but also promotes a sense of unity and shared responsibility that benefits the entire family.In response to the last NTA argument, while it's understandable that the OP's discomfort with cooking can stem from personal feelings, it doesn't negate their responsibility to contribute to family gatherings, especially when a family member is unwell. The OP's choice to avoid cooking could be interpreted as a lack of support for their mother during a difficult time, which can foster feelings of resentment in the family. Family events often require sacrifices and participation, and opting out can strain relationships and create an atmosphere of division rather than unity.

A new argument for the OP being at fault is that their refusal to help out in the kitchen may set a poor example for younger family members or others in the household. By not stepping up when needed, the OP could be reinforcing the notion that it's acceptable to prioritize personal discomfort over familial obligations. This behavior can discourage a spirit of cooperation and support, which is crucial in family dynamics. Instead of modeling a sense of responsibility and teamwork, the OP's actions may inadvertently teach others that it's okay to disengage when challenges arise, undermining the values of support and collaboration that are essential in a family setting.

In response to the last YTA argument, while it's important to recognize personal boundaries, the OP's refusal to help their sick mother during a family gathering can be perceived as a lack of empathy and support. Family gatherings often require everyone to pitch in, especially when a member is unwell. The OP's decision to avoid cooking, rather than finding a way to assist that aligns with their comfort level, could lead to feelings of isolation for their mother and create tension within the family. It’s essential to strike a balance between personal comfort and familial support, especially during challenging times.

A new argument for the OP being not at fault is that they are setting a precedent for open communication about personal needs and boundaries within the family. By clearly expressing their discomfort with cooking, the OP encourages dialogue about responsibilities that allows family members to discuss their own preferences and limitations. This can lead to a healthier family dynamic where everyone feels empowered to share their feelings and contribute in ways that align with their strengths. Ultimately, by prioritizing honest communication, the OP can pave the way for a more collaborative environment that respects individual boundaries while fostering family unity.","{'score': 3, 'criteria': 'Some grounding but with a few unsupported claims.', 'supporting_evidence': ""The response addresses the family dynamics and responsibilities expected during gatherings, which is relevant to the scenario, but contains speculative statements about the OP's feelings and motivations without direct evidence from the source material.""}","### Summary of Arguments

1oa9jv6,AITA I had my 21st birthday and some guy tried to break into my house,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa9jv6/aita_i_had_my_21st_birthday_and_some_guy_tried_to/,NTA,NTA,True,"So I turned 21 this week - my birthday was on the 15th and we hosted a party on the 18th. Th theme was 'dress as my favorite things' and I bought a karaoke machine for the party. I live in a student area where people are frequently hosting house parties, even then I made sure that our karaoke would not run past 11pm - as our council rules define quiet hours as between 11pm-7am. This was something I made sure that the loud parts of the party would stay between.  At about 8/9pm my friends started showing up we started doing our karaoke, at 10:05pm a neighbour I have never met before showed up at the door and was slamming on both the doorbell and the door, I opened the door thinking it was a friend. He then started screaming in my face about his babies not being able to sleep (he was 70/80) before I could apologise he tried to force his way into our house, stepping over our doormat - he only left when my boyfriend stepped in front of me. I know we were being loud, louder than parties normally in this area. we've handled our previous complaints with ease (the only ever other noise complaint I have had is for the flat above mine and I made the complainers banana bread to apologise).  We immediately turned off the music after he left - however I did end up having a panic attack from the way he yelled at me, and ended up calling 101 (the UK non emergency line) as I was shaken by the experience and that's what my mum said to do.   I now have a meeting with a police officer tomorrow, but don't know if I'm overacting or should have held the party at all?",,"While the original poster attempted to adhere to noise regulations by ending the karaoke at 11 PM, they still failed to consider the impact of their party on their neighbors, particularly given that they acknowledged it was louder than typical parties in the area. By choosing a theme that encouraged exuberant behavior and not being mindful of the potential disturbance to those around them, they contributed to an environment that could reasonably upset neighbors, especially one with young children. The OP's decision to prioritize their celebration over community harmony demonstrates a lack of consideration for others, making them the AITA in this situation.

Refuting the previous YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster did end their karaoke at 11 PM, which is often considered a reasonable hour for social gatherings. The noise was not excessive compared to typical party standards, and the OP made an effort to comply with local noise regulations. Additionally, the OP could not have predicted the specific sensitivities of their neighbors regarding noise, especially if other parties in the area have not prompted similar complaints. 

Moreover, the OP was celebrating a significant milestone, which is a common and joyous occasion. It’s reasonable to expect that celebrations might create some noise, and the OP was respectful in trying to manage it within acceptable limits.

A new concise argument supporting the OP is that they actively sought to limit the disturbance by concluding the karaoke at a reasonable hour and being mindful of local noise ordinances. This demonstrates a genuine effort to balance their right to celebrate with the need to be considerate of their neighbors, thereby absolving them of fault in this situation.Refuting the previous argument that the OP is not at fault, it’s essential to acknowledge that while they adhered to a standard end time for noise, they ignored the specific context and dynamics of their neighborhood. The OP mentioned that their party was louder than typical gatherings, indicating a clear awareness that their celebration was potentially disruptive. Even with good intentions, they failed to take proactive steps to mitigate the noise during the event, such as setting clear volume limits or communicating with neighbors ahead of time about the party.

A new concise argument supporting the OP being at fault is that their choice to host a loud, exuberant celebration without adequately considering the comfort and needs of their neighbors, especially those with children, shows a lack of empathy. This disregard for the impact of their actions on the community highlights a selfish approach to their celebration, making them responsible for the discord created by their party.

Refuting the previous argument that the OP is at fault, it’s crucial to recognize that the OP did make an effort to comply with community norms by ending the karaoke at 11 PM, which is generally considered an acceptable time for social gatherings. The OP’s intention was to celebrate a milestone, and they took steps to ensure the festivities were within legal noise limits. Additionally, the OP had no prior complaints about noise from neighbors, suggesting that their celebrations were in line with what is typically tolerated in the neighborhood.

A new concise argument supporting the OP's position is that they were celebrating a significant life event—a milestone birthday—which naturally involves a level of festivity and noise. It is reasonable to expect that such occasions may create some disturbance, and the OP’s actions were not out of line with common social practices. They attempted to balance their celebration with neighborly respect, making it unfair to place the entire burden of responsibility on them for the situation.Refuting the previous argument that the OP is not at fault, it's important to emphasize that even though they ended the karaoke at 11 PM, they acknowledged that their party was louder than typical gatherings. This suggests a level of awareness about the potential disturbance their actions could cause. The OP's decision to host a loud event without adequately mitigating the noise shows a lack of consideration for their neighbors and their right to peace, especially those with young children who may have been adversely affected by the noise levels.

A new concise argument supporting the OP being at fault is that while celebrating life events is important, it is equally crucial to be mindful of the community and its dynamics. The OP could have taken additional steps to ensure their festivities did not disrupt their neighbors, such as informing them in advance or moderating the volume more strictly. This lack of foresight and consideration reflects a disregard for shared living spaces and community harmony, ultimately placing the OP at fault in this situation.

Refuting the previous argument that the OP is at fault, it's vital to understand that the OP made reasonable efforts to celebrate their significant milestone while adhering to local noise regulations. Ending the karaoke at 11 PM is generally considered respectful behavior, especially in residential areas. The OP also mentioned that they had not received previous complaints about their gatherings, indicating that their celebrations were consistent with community standards and expectations.

A new concise argument supporting the OP is that they demonstrated a commitment to being a good neighbor by adhering to noise ordinances and concluding the party at a socially acceptable hour. The nature of celebrations—especially for milestones—often includes some level of noise, and it’s unreasonable to expect complete silence during such events. The OP's actions were within the bounds of typical social behavior, suggesting they should not be held solely responsible for any disturbances experienced by their neighbors.Refuting the previous argument that the OP is at fault, it's important to highlight that while the OP's party may have been louder than typical, they took steps to comply with local noise regulations and ended the festivities at a reasonable hour. This demonstrates a willingness to balance their celebration with consideration for their neighbors. The OP's acknowledgment of the noise levels indicates they were not completely oblivious to the potential for disturbance, which implies they were making efforts to be respectful rather than negligent.

A new concise argument supporting the OP is that celebrations are a normal part of community life and should be expected to come with some noise. The OP's actions—hosting a party, managing the volume, and concluding activities at 11 PM—are consistent with common social practices. It’s unreasonable to expect complete quiet during such events, and the OP's efforts to celebrate responsibly highlight that they should not be held entirely accountable for the discomfort experienced by their neighbors.

Refuting the previous argument that the OP is at fault, it’s essential to recognize that the OP did adhere to a reasonable timeframe by ending their karaoke at 11 PM, which is a typical time for social events to conclude in many communities. The OP demonstrated an intention to respect local noise regulations and did not have prior complaints from neighbors about noise disturbances, suggesting that their celebration was in line with community norms.

A new concise argument supporting the OP is that they were celebrating a significant life event, which inherently involves a level of noise and festivity. The OP's efforts to manage the volume and end the party at a reasonable hour demonstrate their consideration for neighbors. Celebrations are a natural part of community life, and while some noise is expected, the OP's actions show they were mindful of maintaining a balance between enjoyment and respect for their neighbors' peace, thus absolving them of fault in this situation.Refuting the previous argument that the OP is at fault, it's crucial to acknowledge that the OP made a conscious effort to comply with local noise regulations by ending their karaoke at 11 PM. This demonstrates a clear intention to be considerate of their neighbors. Furthermore, the OP noted that their party was louder than typical gatherings, which indicates they were aware of the potential for disturbance but chose to celebrate nonetheless. This doesn’t inherently make them at fault; many gatherings may exceed normal noise levels without causing undue harm or conflict.

A new concise argument supporting the OP is that the responsibility for community harmony is shared among all residents. While the OP may have created some noise, it is unreasonable to expect complete silence during celebrations, especially in a neighborhood where social gatherings are common. The OP's actions, including adhering to noise regulations and concluding festivities at a reasonable hour, reflect a balanced approach to celebrating—a part of life that should be embraced rather than stifled. Therefore, the OP should not bear the entire burden of fault in this situation.

Refuting the previous argument that the OP is at fault, it’s important to emphasize that the OP made a reasonable effort to celebrate their milestone while adhering to local noise regulations by ending karaoke at 11 PM. This action shows a commitment to being considerate of their neighbors' peace. The OP had not received prior complaints about noise, indicating that their celebrations were generally acceptable within the community context.

A new concise argument supporting the OP is that celebrations—especially significant life events—are a natural part of community life, and they inherently involve some level of noise. The OP's actions were in line with common social practices, and they attempted to balance their enjoyment with respect for their neighbors.

The arguments supporting NTA emphasize the OP's adherence to noise regulations, the communal nature of celebrations, and the absence of prior complaints, suggesting that they acted reasonably within the context of their neighborhood. Conversely, the YTA arguments focus on the impact of the noise on neighbors and the OP's lack of proactive measures.

1oa92qz,AITA for telling my roommate not to clean the apartment at night,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa92qz/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_not_to_clean_the/,NTA,NTA,True,"I'm living in an apartment with two roommates, so we're three total. Each of us have their own room and we share a kitchen and a bathroom. One of my roommates came back from studying abroad for a year, so he is still often rearranging stuff in the apartment. I probably should mention that the roommate in question is neurodivergent with ADHD, so it is difficult for him to follow a regular schedule.   I sleep very lightly and react very negatively to noise while trying to sleep. Also I really value going to sleep ""early"" (earlier than my roommates that is, anything from 11pm-1am is usual for me) and getting at least eight hours of it. Because of this I've already had discussions with my roommates a few times, because they either don't mind noise or go to sleep very late. I've told them multiple times that it bothers me if they're being noisy at night.  So in this instance I was trying to sleep at 22:45 when I hear my roommate being really loud in the hallway, rearranging stuff and turning on the vacuum cleaner which woke me up instantly. I waited for a few minutes, but when I realized it would be a longer thing I went out of my room to confront him about it. I tried to ask nicely if he could try being more quiet and told him that I don't think it's okay to vaccume this late in the day because I want to sleep and it might bother the neighbours. He responded that he will try to be more quiet but also that he will continue vacuuming at some point this night. He told me that this is the only time he has the chance to do it and he really wants to clean the place. He insisted that his interest in cleaning up the place is just as legit as my interest in sleeping, so I should try to be more sympathetic to him.  We discussed it some more and eventually he did concede to do me a favour, but still thinks he's in the right. In the end I felt quite bad about it and wonder if I am ta for stopping my roommates from doing things that are important to them because of me wanting to go to sleep at a reasonable time.  Edit: for anyone interested, he still makes noise at night, vacuuming, assembling his furniture and so on even though I told him I'm not okay with it. He just doesn't ask me anymore.",,"The original poster is the asshole because they are prioritizing their own sleep schedule over their roommate's legitimate need to clean and organize their living space.

**YTA (You're the Asshole) Arguments:**
1. The original poster (OP) is prioritizing their sleep schedule over their roommate's legitimate need to clean and organize, especially considering the neurodivergent roommate's unique challenges with time management.
2. OP is imposing strict limitations on when their roommate can engage in necessary activities, which can lead to resentment and conflict.
3. A collaborative approach, such as setting designated cleaning hours that accommodate everyone, would be more empathetic and conducive to a harmonious living environment.
4. OP's rigid enforcement of quiet periods stifles their roommate's ability to function well, indicating a lack of flexibility and understanding.

**NTA (Not the Asshole) Arguments:**
1. OP has a right to a peaceful environment during their designated sleep hours, which is equally important as the roommate's need to clean.
2. OP is setting necessary boundaries to maintain their mental and physical health, advocating for their own well-being in a shared living situation.
3. Communication and compromise are vital; however, OP's request for quiet is a reasonable expression of their needs, not an unreasonable demand.
4. Establishing quiet hours is a fundamental aspect of cohabitation, and respecting each other's schedules is essential for a respectful living arrangement.

### Conclusion
The debate revolves around the importance of compromise and communication in shared living situations versus the right to set boundaries for personal well-being. The arguments for YTA emphasize the need for empathy and flexibility, especially considering the neurodivergent roommate's challenges. Conversely, the NTA arguments focus on the validity of OP's need for quiet during sleep and the importance of establishing personal boundaries.

After evaluating both sides, it appears that the NTA arguments provide a stronger case for the importance of mental health and the right to a peaceful living environment.

They feel as if I’m not a friend to them regarding I rarely text/call them outside of work even though we spend a lot of time talking at work. I have explained to them that I’m not much of a texter or caller but they still think as friends we should be calling/texting everyday. I feel as if it is childish for them to expect that. I feel like those are more relationship standards than they are friendship standards. AITA?,,"You're the YTA because maintaining friendships often requires effort beyond just the time spent together at work. While it's understandable that not everyone is a frequent communicator, making an effort to check in with friends through calls or texts demonstrates care and investment in the relationship. Your friends may feel neglected or undervalued, and dismissing their feelings as childish overlooks the importance of nurturing friendships outside of the workplace. A simple message can go a long way in strengthening bonds and showing that you appreciate them beyond just your professional interactions.

While it’s true that friendships require effort, the last YTA argument overlooks a critical aspect: the original poster's circumstances. If the poster has been dealing with significant personal or professional challenges, their capacity to reach out might be limited, not due to a lack of care, but because they are managing their own stressors. It’s essential to consider that everyone has different thresholds for social interaction, especially during tough times. The poster's friends should also be understanding of their situation and not expect constant communication, as true friends can empathize with each other’s struggles.

Additionally, the original poster may have shown their commitment in other ways that aren't immediately visible, such as being present and supportive when needed. This context highlights that the poster is not at fault; rather, mutual understanding and support should be the focus in maintaining friendships.You're the YTA because maintaining friendships requires mutual effort, and your friends deserve more than just passive acknowledgment. While you might be preoccupied with your own challenges, that doesn’t negate the importance of reaching out and checking in. Your friends’ feelings of neglect are valid, and dismissing them as childish undermines the emotional investment they’ve put into the friendship. Relationships thrive on communication, and failing to make even minimal effort can lead to feelings of abandonment or resentment. If you truly value these friendships, it’s essential to actively engage, even during tough times, to show that you care and appreciate them beyond the workplace.

The last YTA argument assumes that the original poster is neglecting their friendships due to a lack of effort, but this fails to consider the context of their situation. The original poster may be dealing with personal challenges that limit their ability to engage socially. It’s important to recognize that everyone has different capacities for maintaining relationships, especially during stressful periods. Instead of labeling the poster as at fault, we should acknowledge that they may be doing their best under the circumstances. True friendship is also about understanding and supporting one another during tough times, which includes respecting each other’s boundaries and recognizing when one might need space. 

Additionally, the original poster could have shown their commitment in ways that aren’t immediately visible to their friends, such as being there when it truly matters. This highlights that the poster is not at fault; rather, the focus should be on mutual understanding and support as both sides navigate their respective challenges.You're the YTA because maintaining friendships requires mutual effort and consideration. While it's understandable that you may be dealing with personal challenges, dismissing your friends' feelings as childish shows a lack of empathy and respect for their emotional needs. Friendships thrive on communication and connection, and failing to make any effort, even in small ways, can leave your friends feeling unvalued and neglected. 

Furthermore, it's important to recognize that friendships are not solely about being present during good times; they also involve supporting one another during tough periods. If your friends are expressing feelings of neglect, it's your responsibility to acknowledge those feelings and make an effort to reach out, even if it's just a simple message or check-in. Ignoring their concerns perpetuates a cycle of emotional distance and can ultimately damage the friendships you claim to value. True friendship means being there for each other, even when it's challenging.

The last YTA argument overlooks an important factor: the original poster's circumstances. While friendships indeed require effort, it’s essential to recognize that everyone has different capacities for maintaining relationships, particularly during challenging times. If the original poster is juggling personal or professional stressors, their ability to reach out may be limited—not out of disregard for their friends, but because they are navigating their own difficulties. 

Moreover, true friendship is built on mutual understanding and support. It's unfair for friends to expect constant communication without considering the context of the poster's situation. Instead of labeling the poster as at fault, we should advocate for empathy and patience within friendships, recognizing that sometimes, a friend may need space to manage their own life while still valuing the friendship deeply. In this sense, the original poster is not at fault; they deserve understanding as they work through their challenges.You're the YTA because maintaining friendships requires active engagement, regardless of personal challenges. While it's understandable that you may be facing difficulties, dismissing your friends' feelings as childish overlooks the fundamental responsibility we have to nurture our relationships. Ignoring their need for communication can lead to feelings of neglect and resentment, which can ultimately damage the friendships you value. 

Moreover, friendships are a two-way street. If your friends are reaching out and expressing their feelings, it’s crucial to acknowledge their concerns rather than deflecting them. True friendship means making an effort to connect, even if it's just a quick message or check-in. By not doing so, you risk giving the impression that you don’t care about their feelings or the relationship itself. Acknowledging your friends' needs and actively participating in the friendship, even during tough times, is essential for maintaining strong and healthy connections.

The last YTA argument fails to consider the complexity of human relationships and the original poster's circumstances. While maintaining friendships does require effort, it is equally important to acknowledge that everyone has different capacities for social engagement, especially during challenging times. The original poster may be navigating personal struggles that limit their ability to reach out, which doesn’t reflect a lack of care for their friends. 

Moreover, friendships should also involve understanding and support from both sides. If the friends are expressing feelings of neglect, it’s crucial to approach the situation with empathy rather than judgment. True friends should be willing to communicate openly about their needs while also being patient with one another during difficult periods. Instead of placing blame, we should encourage mutual understanding, recognizing that the original poster is not at fault for needing space while still valuing their friendships.You're the YTA because maintaining friendships is not just about the occasional social interaction; it requires consistent effort and emotional investment. While you may be dealing with personal challenges, that doesn't excuse neglecting your friends, especially when they are reaching out for connection. Dismissing their feelings as childish undermines the importance of their emotional needs and the mutual support that friendships require.

Additionally, friendships thrive on communication. If you value these relationships, it's essential to make an effort to check in, even in small ways. Ignoring your friends' attempts to connect sends a message that their feelings and the friendship itself are not a priority for you. By not engaging with them, you're risking the deterioration of these important relationships, which could lead to feelings of abandonment on their part. True friendship means actively participating and showing that you care, even when times are tough.

The last YTA argument overlooks a crucial point: the original poster's circumstances may significantly affect their ability to maintain frequent communication. While friendships do require effort, it's essential to recognize that individuals often go through challenging periods that can limit their social interactions. If the original poster is experiencing personal struggles, their capacity to engage with friends may understandably diminish, not because they don't care, but because they are managing their own difficulties.

Furthermore, true friendship is characterized by understanding and support during tough times. Instead of blaming the original poster for perceived neglect, friends should recognize that everyone has different thresholds for social engagement. Mutual empathy is vital; if friends genuinely care for each other, they should be willing to extend grace and understanding when one is facing challenges.

The YTA side prioritizes active engagement and communication, suggesting that neglect is unacceptable. In contrast, the NTA side emphasizes empathy and the complexities of personal circumstances, advocating for understanding and support from both sides.

While both sides present valid points, the NTA arguments highlight that friendship requires compassion and recognition of each other's challenges, particularly during difficult times.
