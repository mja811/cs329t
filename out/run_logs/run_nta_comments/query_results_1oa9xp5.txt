=== QUERY ===
My bf &amp; I recently moved in together&amp; are having a bonfire tn with a few
of his friends. His ex roommate has been dating this girl on&amp;off the past
year or so. Ive had minimal interactions w her but everytime ive seen her in
person she says nothing to me unless I say hi first then shell say hi. Shes told
my bfs roommate from the get go that shes worried he wants to date me&amp;that
im flirting w him. Both my bf&amp; his room mate know this isnt true. My bf and
I have a really good relationship&amp; theres never been attraction or
flirtation between me&amp;his room mate or any1 else for that matter  Room mates
gf has messaged me several times on fb telling me she knows im attracted to her
bf &amp; that I exclude her by not saying hi when I see her(shes referencing a
time when she didnt hear me say hi&amp; found it rude). She doesnt believe me or
my bf when we tell her im not attracted to her bf. She also asked me to stop
talking to her bf &amp; i told her im not going to ignore him when im at my bfs
house &amp; his rm-mate starts talking to both of us.   She even snooped so far
back on my fb &amp; found a post I shared 10 or so years ago &amp; sent it to
her bf w no context, asking him if he liked it&amp;when he said yeah she told
him i had posted it(It wasnt even my original post, i just shared smthing). Her
mssges&amp;stalking my fb were so anxiety inducing at one point I blocked her.
She then found me on insta&amp;sent me a message telling me i was petty for
blocking her,which I didnt even notice until she screen shot it, sent it to my
bf&amp;then blocked him I unblocked her cause I felt bad and to explain why id
blocked her in the first place Also she wont say a single thing to me in person
&amp;ive invited her to hang w us several times but she never comes  Recently
she &amp;her bf broke up. Its happened a couple times &amp; im not super close w
my bfs rm-mate so I didnt think much of it until she sent me a message on fb
telling me they broke up&amp; asking me if I could find him someone else to
date. This is like within a week of them breaking up. I found this really weird
and it made me even more anxious. I responded by telling her my bf, who was
still living w him, could check on him&amp; left it at that  That brings us to
the present. my bf moved in last week &amp; we invited his ex room mate over for
this bon fire. I didnt think the gf would be a problem bc they arent 2gether but
today he asked if she could come with. my bf &amp; I both said no. He said this
made her sad &amp; he might not come  I really dont want her at my hosue. Shes
made me so anxious &amp; it honestly makes me feel crazy that she even asked to
come w after everything My bf is more chill abt her coming over but hes also
supportive of me not wanting to see her  AITA? Should I let her come over? I
feel bad that my bfs friend isnt gonna come now &amp; im worried shes gonna
isolate him from his friends esp if hes living alone now

I (26f) moved into a 2b2b apartment in August with a girl (21f). The apartment
was a great deal for the area and we were able to keep out of each other's ways
while still being friendly . Several weeks ago, we went out with a friend of
hers (33M), who she had recently started hanging out/hooking up with. This was
meant to be a night to celebrate an accomplishment of mine, but by the time we
found him (walking on the street with his phone dead at 11 after he left a
concert) he was completely trashed. She spends the night babysitting him while
he was 1) aggressive with guys around us 2) flirted and openly ogled every
person with tits that walked by. I was fine to watch the drama but we went to a
bar where he called a guy a f\*g for not buying me a drink (I am non-binary and
bi). He said this while aggressively stepping up to the guy and getting in his
space. He proceeds to be super rude the whole time. I told her that night I did
not want to hang out with him again A week later I'm woken up at 4am by him
being loud in the kitchen talking to my roommate. I had to text her to quiet
down, then come out of my room to say it again because he didn't stop. they
moved to her room where they got in a screaming match in front of her two
friends who were with her. It turns out he had spent the night flirting with the
girl they were with and repeatedly told her to "show \[him\] her tits." He was
also drunk and aggressive and she kicked him out. He then forgot his backpack
and knocked and rang our doorbell at 4:45am multiple times since she didn't take
his calls. After all of this, I told her I did not want him coming over and she
said it was fine bc he was blocked. Last week, who sleeps over but this guy. I
always hear them when he comes in at night bc he is so loud. I told her again
even if she wants to be friends with him, I don't want him in the house. I
explained to her that I have anxiety and ptsd and his behavior has made me
uncomfortable with him to the point where I don't want him here, especially when
I am asleep because it spikes my anxiety and makes me feel unsafe. She thinks
this is not a fair restriction of me to ask of her. Her arguments are basically
1) both of us should be allowed to do whatever we want in our rooms so long as
it doesn't affect the other one and since this only affects me bc of my
issues/feelings, its not fair to make her change her behavior. 2) (in response
to me suggesting that he only sleep over 1 or maybe 2 nights a week if its
really that important to her or limit it to weekends) that she does not schedule
her plans like that and its not reasonable to change that for me. She argued
that she's not a child and can do what she wants and roommates can't set rules
for each other or dictate what the other does. 3) He's a good guy and I'm just
judging him on two bad nights and should talk to him to get over my issues. I
really think I'm being reasonable, but I'm not sure what to do. Would love
thoughts on why I'm wrong or right.

Title: AITA for telling my roomate that her best friend's fiance is not invited to our parties?

I (27F) live with my boyfriend (25M) and his sister (27F) who is also one of my
good friends. I will refer to my boyfriend's sister as my roomate throughout
this post, but I wanted to be clear that our lives are more intertwined than
your average roomates. We frequently have friends come over and host parties,
and the vibes are good, EXCEPT... when my roomate's best friend's fiance comes
around. I will refer to my roomate's best friend as R and her best friend's
fiance as J.  J has been a source of discomfort in the friend group since he
started dating R. He has shown many times that he holds bigoted beliefs and he
is emotionally abusive to R, who we care about. Not only that, but R and J
constantly argue, even at these gatherings where we're all trying to have fun.
After months of this, it began to reach a point where all our friend group
talked about was how much they hated J, mostly because my roomate kept bringing
it up in conversation. Even at parties, most of our friends were eavesdropping
on their arguments or complaining about how terrible J was to R, and nobody was
having any fun. Yet, my roomate wasn't willing to stop inviting R and J to
parties because she was worried R would be isolated.  While I understand, I have
been in an abusive relationship before, and was not only very triggered by J,
but also sick of how my roomate's enabling was affecting everyone. I set a
boundary and said I did not want J coming to our parties anymore, and everyone
agreed. My roomate didn't agree, but respected is and told R that J was no
longer welcome.  R then got angry at everyone for not "talking to her" about it,
expressing no care about how uncomfortable they had made everyone. Since then,
they have not been in attendance at group gatherings, and while we were sad that
R chose J over us, we understood. Since then, things have been fine.  It's been
a few months, and my roomate has been repeatedly bringing up how J "took it to
heart and has changed". I don't believe that anyone is capable of changing their
whole personality and belief system in a year, never mind a few months, and have
expressed my skepticism. Recently, my roomate and my boyfriend were both talking
about this, and my roomate mentioned that she had invited R and J to our
upcoming party.   I didn't say anything at the time (my bad, I know) but I saw
this as a boundary violation, and was pissed that my roomate had not asked us
how we felt about inviting R and J beforehand when we had already made it clear
that J was NOT welcome. It took me awhile to talk to my roomate about it because
she gets very sad when she is confronted with anything, and I find her reaction
to be triggering (OCD + guilt = bad combo), but once I worked up the courage,
she just kept insisting that it wasn't fair for me to make blanket judgements,
that I should "give him a chance" and that J has changed. She is not willing to
reinstate the boundary we all agreed upon. AITA?

Title: AITA for telling my friend off?

So my friend started dating this guy that we had initially met at the gym. I
told her to ask him out cause why not. They started getting pretty close and
this is the first guy I've actually hung out with more than once (with her
included of course) and seems pretty chill. A little after a month or so, he
started joking about setting me up with one of his friends. I have a bf already
and didn't take it seriously cause it was just a joke. This later on turned out
to be more joking which I did not like and told my friend about it. Fast forward
to a couple days before Halloween, we talked about a party we had been waiting
to go to and she suddenly told me that my bf wasn't even considered in the plan
and didn't know it was a possibility of him going. Mind you, we had been talking
about it for about 2 weeks and mentioned that both her and her bf would dress up
and me and bf would too. The party would be at her bf's house with his buddies
and one of their gf's, including me, my bf, and my friend. It got weird to the
point where I had to ask if it was cause they were trying to set me up with her
bf's friend and she said that he wouldn't be there. She started being vague or
just not answering any question I had about the party which is weird cause she
always goes into detail and gets excited about going out. She hasn't answered me
in 3 days because I told her it wasn't fair he's suddenly not included but I
still am. AITA for telling her off? It may not seem like a big deal but it's not
okay for my friend of 10 years to be on her bf's side when she's barely known
him for more than a month. She's basically throwing away our friendship for this
guy. P.S. I never ended up going to the party cause I was not comfortable going
with drunk people there. It was also out of respect to my bf that I didn't go.
I'm not sure what to do about this friendship cause she's never done anything
like this before. Should I message her again? What would I say?

Hey so I need some outside opinions from my immediate circle. I (21f) live in my
childhood home and my parents moved so it automatically made me want one of my
best friends (22f) to move in. After three months of living together she asked
me if her boyfriend (~24 ish?) could move in, I declined and said I wanted to
live with a friend and that they should actually move out together if that’s
what they want. I know that he has not the best home life in terms of not having
a solid room and sleeping in car/ on floor/etc. I have been open to him staying
over, but it became a pattern of 4/7 days of the week he’s here. He’s very
introverted and doesn’t talk to me unless I do, I don’t get a good morning or
hey I’m leaving in a bit from him. I just sometimes hear footsteps and have to
think it’s him. Recently we had friends over and he happened to be at the house,
didn’t bother to join because he was tired my friend said. I barely have a
relationship with my friend anymore because I just have this feeling that he
makes her more introverted and they always want to be with each other. We
haven’t done something just me and her for months. I think I just needed to get
this off my chest and if anyone has experienced something similar that would be
great to hear.

Post ID: 1ohsysf

I (f27) share an apartment with my friend (f25). She has been dating her
boyfriend since February. In the beginning he would occasionally stay over
(one/two nights per week) and she would sleep at his place once/twice per week.
This summer they went on vacation together and they have been inseparable ever
since. Having dinner and spending the night together every single night, 50/50
at our place and his place (he owns a studio by himself about a 45 minute drive
away). There is nothing in our lease about guests or key-usage by third parties.
After the summer she told me she had given him spare keys because he finishes
work a little bit earlier than she does, and it would be more practical if he
can come here without having to wait 30 minutes. I was not amused to say the
least, I had a conversation with her she has to communicate such things
beforehand and that it really wasn't cool because they were actually my keys
(she thought they were spare keys for general usage). We agreed it was alright
if he had keys for those 30 minutes now and then if it would be more practical
to let himself in, but that I didn't want him unattended for prolonged periods
of time because he is still a guest after all.  Fast forward to today, my
roommate leaves to go to the gym, and 5 minutes later I hear him come into our
home and start cooking. After a good 2 hours I come into the living room and
notice my roommate still hasn't returned. It was not the first time, so I felt
like I was well within my right to set this boundary again. I calmly asked him
if he was aware of the agreements about the keys, to which he said he wasn't. In
the middle of that conversation my roommate returns. I calmly explained to the
two of them we made clear agreements, but that this was really pushing my limits
and that I felt uncomfortable, 2 hours of him being here while she is out at the
gym is not the 30 minutes that would be more practical with work-schedules. It
is not what we agreed upon, I feel uncomfortable, please come up with a
solution, that's it. All explained very calmly, no raised voice, no unnecessary
accusing, no derailing from the topic.   The two of them reacted quite vicious,
that she wasn't aware I would take our agreement so literally, that they didn't
see another solution (mind you, they made it work for 5 months before he had
keys), that they really didn't see the problem, that he always stayed in her
room if he was here so early (he wouldn't have to stay in her room for 2 hours
if they would stick to the agreements). Then they flipped the script on me, what
I think would be a good solution, and how I would be if I had a boyfriend. I
calmly explained it is their relationship and their schedules, they should
arrange something that fits all of our boundaries accordingly. They finished by
saying I am unreasonable for bringing it up and that they for sure would get
back to me.   It has left quite a sour aftertaste and now I'm not sure anymore
if I'm not overreacting...
