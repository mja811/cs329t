1oad7wt,AITA for telling my mom her boyfriend isn't welcome to events anymore?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oad7wt/aita_for_telling_my_mom_her_boyfriend_isnt/,NTA,YTA,False,"I, (28F) have recently told my mother her I will no longer be going out to see her at her home, where she and her boyfriend, let's call him Fred, live, and he is no longer welcome to come here under any circumstance. For context, my mom lives about an hour away, and with work schedules and all, we don't see each other too often to start. Now, she and ""Fred"", have been together for about 6 years, and have lived together for about 5, and she made the move out of town to be with him. Since myself and my younger brother were already grown and out of the house already, and she has been seeing him for a year already, they were making plans to move in together, but since his kids were younger, I believe 18 and 16 at the time, it made sense for her to move out there. We were all fond of Fred when she had introduced him, and after her long history with abusive relationships, he seemed like a great change, and we were happy for her. My mom, relocating, didn't know anyone out there other than Fred and his family, and since relocating had to start a new job. Everything seemed fine until fast forward a year or so when his behavior started to change. He is constantly accusing her of cheating (despite never doing so), always questioning her whereabouts, and even makes comments about her weight. So over the years, I would get phone calls of her crying, and saying how she can't do it anymore. Her being my mother, I always tried to help, and even offered for her to stay with me and my family until she found something for herself. But, he'd apologize , and all was forgiven. This has happened about a dozen times in the last 5 years, and always she forgives him, and everything is all dandy again.  Now, fast forward to a few weeks ago. I got one of these phone calls, again, and so did my brother. This time seemed like it was it. So myself, brother, sister in-law and my husband were making plans to get her out and to set her up back here in our town. But low and behold, two days later, he apologized and everything was forgiven, again. So my brother and I had said enough was enough, and if she was ever serious about leaving, we will 100% be there for her, and she is always welcome here to visit, but is no longer welcome, since we cannot pretend to fake nice to a man who treats our mother like garbage. I also have two young children who have started to ask why he says mean things to their grandma, and said I don't want her to model that type of relationship to them. But she has sense said I'm being, quote ""immature, mean, and that is uncalled for since he's 'trying"""", and is telling other family members I'm trying to cut her out, when I have said she is still always welcome. AITA for saying he cannot come anymore? Or should I just bare it for the sake of not losing my mother and the relationship with her grandkids?","I (50F) am the mom in this situation, and my daughter (28F) has just told me she won’t come to my home anymore, and that my boyfriend of 6 years—call him “Fred” (52M)—is not welcome at her house under any circumstance. We live about an hour apart. I moved to his town about 5 years ago after dating a year; my kids (she and her younger brother) were already out of the house, and he still had two teens (then 18 and 16) at home, so logistically it made sense. When I introduced him back then, everyone liked him—especially because, after a long history of really bad relationships, he felt like a calm, steady change. I didn’t know anyone out here and had to start over with a new job, so yes, I leaned on him and his family while I built a life.

About a year or so in, we hit a rough patch. He has jealousy issues from past betrayal, and he said some dumb, hurtful things—questioned my whereabouts, made a few comments about my weight that I shut down immediately. None of this is something I’m proud of or think is okay. But we talked, I set boundaries, he apologized (many times), and we started working on it. We’ve done counseling (couples and individual), he’s made changes, and on the day-to-day he’s supportive. He helped me through a surgery, he’s been present for holidays, he’s helped my grandkids with bikes and school projects. It hasn’t been perfect, but it hasn’t been the monster picture my daughter is now painting either.

Here’s where I own my part: when I felt low, I vented to my kids. I called crying on bad days. Sometimes you just need your family to listen. But me asking for an ear during an argument got turned into “sound the alarm, rescue mom.” There have been a handful of times in the last few years where I told them I couldn’t do this anymore, then after we calmed down and actually talked, I changed my mind. That’s called trying to work through a relationship. My daughter and son decided that because I didn’t follow their plan to leave on their timeline, they’re done “faking nice.” They organized a whole extraction—talked about setting me up back in their town, had everyone looped in—without even pausing to hear that I wasn’t asking for that right then. When I stayed, they took it as a betrayal.

A few weeks ago it flared again. I vented. Two days later, he apologized, and we set new ground rules. My daughter’s response was to ban him from her house and refuse to come to mine. She says it’s because she doesn’t want her kids seeing “mean comments to Grandma.” I get that. I also don’t want my grandkids seeing adults freeze out family members, talk about them like they’re trash, or weaponize access to punish choices they don’t like. The couple of times my grandkids overheard tense words, it was addressed and apologized for, and we made a point to keep disagreements private. She keeps telling me she “can’t pretend to be nice,” but being civil for a few hours so your mom can have a birthday, a holiday, or a backyard barbecue with her family isn’t pretending—it’s maturity.

She claims this is a boundary, but it isn’t. A boundary is “I won’t tolerate X behavior in my home.” What she’s doing is an ultimatum: “Leave him or lose time with us and the grandkids.” She refuses to visit me in my home under any conditions, even if it’s just me there. She refuses to let him ever step foot in hers, even for the kids’ birthdays, even if there are clear ground rules and consequences. She’s retelling my private low moments to extended family and calling him “garbage,” then acting shocked that I said she was being immature and mean. She says I’m “modeling a bad relationship” to her kids, while she’s modeling that love is conditional and that you punish people into compliance. That is not healthier.

I’m not asking her to love him. I’m asking for basic respect for my choices and the reality that grown adults sometimes work through hard seasons. He has never laid a hand on me, never threatened me, and when he’s crossed a line verbally, it’s been owned and addressed. We have structure in place. We are doing the work. Cutting him off and isolating me from my own family doesn’t help; it just makes me feel like I have to choose, and I won’t be bullied into that. If she truly wanted to protect her kids without blowing up our family, there were reasonable options: meet in neutral places, set time-limited visits, spell out zero tolerance for snide comments, step outside with me if tensions rise. She didn’t try any of that. She jumped straight to scorched earth.

So yes, I told her that calling me “immature” for staying and branding him as unwelcome forever was uncalled for. I told her she was being mean. Because she is. She took my venting and turned it into a campaign, and now she’s trying to control my life by dangling the grandkids. That’s not a boundary; that’s leverage. If anyone is at fault here, it’s her—for making this an all-or-nothing power play instead of respecting that I’m an adult capable of making my own choices and asking only for basic civility so we can keep this family intact.","The original poster (OP) is at fault because she is imposing an ultimatum on her mother that disregards her mother's autonomy and the complexity of her relationship with Fred. While OP's concerns about her mother's well-being are valid, her approach—completely banning Fred from family events and refusing to see her mother unless he is excluded—demonstrates a lack of respect for her mother's choice to try and work through her relationship. This not only alienates her mother but also risks damaging their relationship by treating her choices as unacceptable. Instead of fostering open communication and support, OP's actions create a hostile environment that pressures her mother into conforming to her expectations, which is not a healthy or mature way to address familial concerns.

While the last YTA argument raises valid points about the importance of respecting autonomy, it overlooks a crucial aspect of OP's situation: the emotional and psychological impact Fred's presence has had on her family, particularly her mother. OP is not at fault because she is prioritizing her own mental well-being and setting boundaries for a healthy family dynamic. 

The new argument is that OP is taking a stand against a relationship that she perceives to be harmful to her mother. By expressing her concerns and setting boundaries regarding Fred, OP is acting as a protective figure in her mother's life, especially if past experiences with Fred have caused distress or harm. It's essential to acknowledge that OP's actions stem from a place of care and concern, not malice, and she is entitled to advocate for a family environment that feels safe and supportive for herself and her loved ones.The original poster (OP) is at fault because she is imposing an ultimatum on her mother that disregards her mother's autonomy and the complexity of her relationship with Fred.

In refutation of the last NTA argument, it’s important to recognize that while OP's intentions may be protective, the manner in which she is enforcing her boundaries is detrimental. Protectiveness can easily morph into control when one party dictates terms to another. In this case, OP's refusal to engage with her mother unless Fred is excluded disregards her mother’s autonomy and choice-making capabilities. It is crucial for OP to engage in a dialogue that respects her mother's agency, rather than imposing a condition that could lead to resentment and further estrangement.

A new argument for OP being at fault is that her stance risks alienating her mother further and could push her away instead of encouraging her to make healthier choices. By creating an environment where her mother feels she must choose between her daughter and her partner, OP is inadvertently fostering division rather than understanding. This approach not only jeopardizes their relationship but also may prevent her mother from seeking support when she genuinely needs it, which could exacerbate any difficulties she may be facing with Fred.

If Fred has a history of causing harm or distress, OP's protective stance is not just a matter of control but a necessary measure to safeguard her mother from potential emotional turmoil. 

A new argument supporting OP is that she is advocating for a healthier family environment. By voicing her concerns and setting boundaries regarding Fred, OP is taking a proactive approach to ensure that family gatherings remain supportive and positive. Families have the right to establish boundaries that protect their emotional well-being, and OP is exercising that right.

The original poster (OP) is not at fault in this situation. While it's true that setting boundaries can sometimes be viewed as controlling, OP's actions are rooted in genuine concern for her mother's well-being. The emotional and psychological impact that Fred has had on OP and her family is significant, and it is entirely reasonable for OP to express her discomfort regarding his presence in their lives, especially if there is a history of harm or distress associated with him.

In refutation of the last YTA argument, it is essential to understand that OP’s protective stance is not merely about control; it reflects her responsibility as a caring daughter. OP has likely witnessed the negative effects of Fred on her mother, and her desire to keep family gatherings safe and positive is a legitimate concern. Rather than disregarding her mother's autonomy, OP is advocating for an environment that prioritizes emotional safety and support for both herself and her mother.

A new argument supporting OP is that she is addressing a potentially harmful situation by setting boundaries that are necessary for her mental health. OP's actions are an expression of love and concern, and by making her feelings clear, she is encouraging her mother to reconsider her choices in a way that promotes self-reflection and growth. In this context, OP's role is not one of control, but rather of a protective advocate for her mother's well-being, which ultimately fosters a healthier family dynamic.The original poster (OP) is at fault because she is imposing an ultimatum on her mother that disregards her mother's autonomy and the complexity of her relationship with Fred.

1o8lauo,AITA if I drop off a note and baked goods to my neighbor who made me pick up somebody else’s dog poop?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o8lauo/aita_if_i_drop_off_a_note_and_baked_goods_to_my/,YTA,YTA,True,"My SO (M33) and I (F32) moved into a new area. I’m careful about my dog going potty on lawns, I ALWAYS pick it up and bring extra bags. Tonight on our walk, our dog went potty immediately. Picked it up and looped around back towards our house from the other direction. Close to home he sniffed another dogs poo and we kept going.   We’re at our door when I hear somebody running up behind startling us. A guy is coming at us with “Your dog pooped on my lawn and you need to pick it up”. I say calmly, “I know for a fact that didn’t happen, you’ve got the wrong dog”. He insists it JUST HAPPENED, he saw it, and has it on camera. I say, “Let’s see the footage because I’m POSITIVE”. My SO didn’t want it to escalate so he says, “Let’s go take a look”. Neighbor puts his hand on my SO’s back and pushes him towards his house. They are of similar cultural background so maybe ok but I didn't like it. I look down and see I have our bag in my hand and yell ahead to them. They didn’t hear me or my SO didn’t want me to get involved. I take a breath, drop off the dog, and head back. If by some miracle my dog had gone without me noticing I would apologize and pick it up.   Neighbor shows me over to where it is and points to the poo in question, I shine my light and I can’t help but literally start laughing out loud. Every oz of diplomacy failed at that moment. It was white, dry, hard as a rock, and TINY. Obviously been sitting there for a long time and where I saw my dog smelling it. I said incredulously, *“*That’s not my dog’s poop, can’t you see how hard it is? It’s old”. He answers, “I’m not here to argue with you-just pick it up.” Now, I’m pissed. I know my SO hates when I argue with people, but I have a strong respect complex. I look this man dead in the face as I scoop it up and say, “Funny how you don’t want to ‘argue’ but you want to make me pick up somebody else’s DOG SHIT. Where’s the camera footage? Would love to see it”. Then my SO hurries me away towards home.  He tells me we should be the bigger people and reminds me there’s so many bigger things in life. Says he also laughed, told him it was super old and also made it clear we didn’t do it. Told him “you must be having a hard time with this issue if you’re having to literally run after people. I’m sorry this happens to you so much”. SO doesn’t let things like that get to him and always feels bad for the out of line person. I often feel the need to correct them. In the grand scheme of things it’s just a piece of poo. But the principle is what gets me. Now here’s where I might be an ahole: I’m considering baking him treats and dropping them with a note like “I’m the bigger person we got off on the wrong foot but you’re still totally wrong and I’m not the one”. My SO thinks it isn’t necessary, and we should ignore him. I’m not trying to start anything bigger but I’m also not a doormat. So Reddit, AITA if I drop off a note and baked goods to my neighbor who made me pick up somebody else’s dog poop?","We’ve had a rough few months with people letting their dogs use our front lawn as a toilet. I’ve picked up more mystery piles than I care to admit, and my kids play out there. I finally put up a camera that faces the strip by the sidewalk because I’m tired of stepping in it or mowing through it. Not trying to be the poop police, just want my yard to be a yard.

New couple on the block moved in with a medium dog. I’ve seen them a few times—seem fine. Tonight I’m washing dishes and glance at the motion alert. I look up and see their dog nose into our grass, circle, lower like it’s about to go. It’s dark and the angle isn’t perfect, but I see the owner standing there while the dog is on the edge of our lawn. I grab a jacket and head out because 1) I am so over this and 2) I don’t want to miss them and end up venting into the void on Nextdoor like everyone else.

By the time I catch them, they’re at their door. I’m a little out of breath and say, “Your dog pooped on my lawn and you need to pick it up.” Direct? Sure. But I wasn’t yelling or cussing. I just wanted it handled right then, not after a 10-minute argument that ends with “we’ll come back later” and never happens.

She immediately goes, calm voice but hard edge, “I know for a fact that didn’t happen, you’ve got the wrong dog.” I tell her it literally just happened and that I have it on camera. To clarify: I have cameras. I check them for this exact reason. I didn’t mean I had a cinematic slow-mo of the poop exiting; I meant I didn’t come out here on a hunch.

Her partner says, “Let’s go take a look,” which I appreciated—it’s the response I was hoping for. We start walking and I guide him toward the strip with a light touch on his back, the same way I’d direct anyone who’s already heading that way. No shoving, no malice. She hangs back and yells that she has a bag. Great! Then it’s a 30-second fix, right?

We get to the spot, I point at the pile by the edge of the grass, and she shines her phone light on it and starts laughing. Laughing. “That’s not my dog’s poop, can’t you see how hard it is? It’s old.” Look, I’m not a poop archivist. Under cold LED light at night, on dormant winter grass, lots of things look white or dried out. Some dogs on high-calcium diets pass chalky stools. We’d had a freeze the other night—things dry fast. What I saw on video was her dog lowering on my lawn, and what I saw on the ground was poop on my lawn. My goal here is not to win a debate about fecal moisture content; it’s to not have feces on my property.

So I say, “I’m not here to argue with you—just pick it up.” Which is exactly true. I am not trying to litigate whether this specific pellet could be carbon-dated to yesterday afternoon. I’m standing in my own yard, pointing at poop, talking to the people whose dog was just there, with a bag already in their hand. The fast, neighborly solution is to pick it up and we all move on.

She gets mad. She stares me down and says while scooping, “Funny how you don’t want to ‘argue’ but you want to make me pick up somebody else’s DOG SHIT. Where’s the camera footage? Would love to see it.” Meanwhile her partner keeps saying variations of “we didn’t do it, but we’ll take care of it” and tries to de-escalate. He even said something empathetic about how this must be an ongoing problem for me (it is). If the encounter had been just him, it would have been over in a minute. Bag it, toss it, good night.

Here’s where I think she’s in the wrong:

- Keep your dog off other people’s lawns. Period. It’s basic etiquette. If your dog is on my grass, lowering like it’s about to go, you lose the benefit of the doubt. At minimum, redirect. If there’s already poop there, apologize and pick it up anyway. It’s not about blame; it’s about respecting someone’s property. My kids roll in that grass. I don’t want anyone’s dog nose-deep in old poo, then trotting through my yard, then me arguing about whether the poop is “fresh enough” to qualify.

- Laughing in your neighbor’s face at 9 p.m. is rude. Even if you believe with your whole soul that your dog didn’t do it, mocking someone for caring about the cleanliness of their own yard is not a good look. I wasn’t accusing them of a crime. I was asking them to remove feces from my property.

- “Show me the footage” in the moment isn’t realistic. I’m outside with you; the footage is on a device inside. I can and did check later. What I saw on replay: your dog stepped onto my grass and dropped into a squat before you tugged the leash. I cannot see a deposit land because of the angle. Could it be another dog’s older poop? Absolutely possible. But this is exactly why the “not here to argue, just please pick it up” line exists. I shouldn’t have to be a forensic analyst to get feces off my lawn.

- If you’re truly “the bigger person,” you don’t escalate, you don’t throw sarcasm grenades, and you definitely don’t bake passive-aggressive apology cookies with a note saying “you’re still totally wrong.” That’s not setting a boundary; that’s poking a neighbor you’re going to live near for years.

Also: I never “ran up” to attack them. I hurried because I’ve had people duck inside and then I’m stuck deciding whether to knock on a stranger’s door about poop. I didn’t “push” anyone—I guided toward the area we were all already walking to. I didn’t say “I’m right, you’re evil;” I said “please pick it up.” There’s a difference.

When they left, I did what I always do: I went back inside, checked the camera, and sighed. It’s exhausting. This whole thing doesn’t have to be dramatic. Most dog owners in our neighborhood keep their pets to the strip between sidewalk and street and pick up. When someone misses, neighbors help each other out. That’s community.

But if your stance is “The principle is what gets me,” here’s a principle: your right to believe your dog is blameless ends at my property line. If there’s poop on my lawn and your dog was just nosing that exact spot, the neighborly response is to err on the side of making it right without the attitude. Don’t argue. Don’t laugh. Don’t plan a petty note with baked goods. Just keep your dog off my grass and, when in doubt, bag it.

I don’t need an apology casserole. I need to not step in crap on my own property. If that makes me the bad guy, fine. But from where I’m standing (on my lawn, holding a flashlight on a pile), the person who turned a simple ask into a performance about “respect” is the one at fault.","The original poster is at fault because their decision to bake treats and drop off a note is not only passive-aggressive but also undermines the very principle they claim to uphold—being a respectful neighbor. Instead of fostering goodwill and resolving the situation amicably, they are choosing to escalate tensions by mocking the neighbor's concern over property cleanliness. This approach is counterproductive and reflects a lack of maturity in handling neighborhood disputes, ultimately damaging community relationships rather than building them.

While it’s understandable that the last YTA argument views the original poster’s actions as passive-aggressive, it's important to recognize that the poster took the initiative to engage with their neighbor in a non-confrontational manner. By baking treats and leaving a note, they were attempting to foster a sense of community rather than escalate tensions. This approach demonstrates a willingness to bridge gaps and promote goodwill, showing that they value neighborly relations despite the conflict. 

Additionally, the original poster is not at fault because they addressed the issue of cleanliness in a lighthearted way, which can often diffuse tension. Instead of responding with anger or defensiveness, they chose a creative and friendly method to communicate, implying a desire for resolution rather than confrontation. This indicates emotional maturity and a genuine intention to maintain a positive neighborhood atmosphere, which should be commended rather than criticized.The original poster is at fault because their actions, while seemingly lighthearted, come across as dismissive of their neighbor's concerns. By opting to bake treats and leave a note rather than directly addressing the cleanliness issue, they are sidestepping an opportunity for genuine communication. This passive approach can be perceived as mocking or trivializing the neighbor's feelings, which only serves to deepen the divide rather than foster understanding. Instead of promoting a positive relationship, the poster's actions risk alienating their neighbor and perpetuating conflict. Clear and direct dialogue would have been a more mature and responsible way to handle the situation.

While the last YTA argument suggests that the original poster’s actions are dismissive, it overlooks the intent behind their approach.

By baking treats and leaving a note, they demonstrated an effort to address the situation without escalating tensions, which can often be more effective in community settings.

Furthermore, this method allows for a less confrontational dialogue. It invites the neighbor to reflect on their concerns in a more relaxed context, potentially leading to a constructive conversation. Instead of perceiving the poster's actions as mockery, it can be interpreted as an attempt to maintain a positive rapport while still acknowledging the neighbor's concerns.

1o8l7hm,AITA: I accidentally bad-mouthed one of the other clubs and the coach overheard me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o8l7hm/aita_i_accidentally_badmouthed_one_of_the_other/,YTA,YTA,True,"Context: I have been training waterpolo for about a year, and where i am there are 4 major clubs that do not represent the country. For the sake of privacy i will reference them as club 1,2,3 and 4 and they are not ranked based on skill or anything like that. Im not the best by any means, infact i think of myself as the worst one there, but i have experience playing for all of them other than club 1.  Now onto the story. So finnaly after one year of being the newest member of club 2, someone else decided to join. This got me excited, and after practice was over i went over to him and decided to be a good teammate and talk to him so he feels welcomed into the club. We met in the lobby after we got dressed from practice and talked a decent bit. I decided to tell him how i got my first golden medal. I told him that even though i play for club 2, on the yearly/grand tournament my coach decided to let the other teams borrow me for 2 reasons: i was the newest one there, being the least of value; and the other clubs where missing players. To be specific, team 3 which was a mixed club (men and women) was missing a goalkeeper, and also the rest of the club wasn't that sharp either as i was faster than all of them during warmups, and team 4 which litteraly had HALF of their players borrowed from either club 1 or 2. Due to these reasons i told him that here there are basically 2 good clubs, club 1 and 2, and that the others suck. (Now even though i barely played for my team, i still won gold because my team won gold, but i dont think this is relevant to the story)  Well as it turns out the coach for team 4 happened to be in the lobby, and when he heard what i said he got defensive and told us that thier club will be good, and that i was playing against thier underaged players.  I feel bad that he heard that, and of course no body wants to hear bas stuff about themselves or something they've poured time into and also because i played for them in the tournament, but i feel like what i said was only the truth as yes, they do suck in comparison to club 1 and 2, while also furhter proving my point as due to the fact that they needed to borrow players in the first olace meant they weren't good enough to compete in the first olace. Also i think that i said nothing wrong - only the trith that happens to be cold and harsh. It wasnt directed as an insult, but only the truth so the new teammate could get a better understanding of the competition.  So am i the asshole?","Context from the other side: I coach at one of the four local waterpolo clubs. For privacy I’ll use the same names: clubs 1,2,3,4. We’re not national teams, we’re community clubs with different sizes and goals. Club 4 (mine) is smaller and very development-focused. We’ve got a lot of U16s and U18s, a couple adults, and we often field mixed rosters so the kids get real game experience. The other clubs have deeper benches and more older players. Between the four clubs we routinely loan players for tournaments so nobody has to forfeit and so more athletes actually get water time. All the coaches are in on this, it’s normal.

After a recent practice night, I was in the lobby finishing facility paperwork and talking to a parent when I heard one of club 2’s newer players chatting up your brand new member. I recognized him because he’d been loaned to us at the last tournament for a few minutes. He was telling the new kid about his first gold medal and basically saying how there are “basically 2 good clubs, club 1 and 2, and the others suck.” He also said we had “half our players borrowed” and that he was faster than everyone on club 3 during warmups, and that he barely played for his own team but still got gold because his team won. He explained he got loaned out because he was the newest one on his team, “least value,” and the other clubs were missing people.

I stepped over and told him that our club will be good, because we’re building, and that in that tournament he was playing mostly against our underaged players. Which is true. We entered so our younger athletes could see real speed and physicality and get that experience. We do that a lot. We are open about it. We also borrowed a few players because we had injuries and exams that weekend. That’s better than canceling and it’s allowed, and it gets kids reps.

Here’s why I think he’s in the wrong, even if he thinks he “just told the truth”:

- There’s a difference between honest and disrespectful. Saying “clubs 3 and 4 suck” in a public lobby where kids, parents, and coaches can hear isn’t neutral information for a new teammate; it’s trash talk. You can talk about relative strength without demeaning people who are literally still learning to eggbeater.

- Context matters. Our roster that day was mostly U16/U18. We put them against older, bigger, faster athletes on purpose so they learn. That’s not us “being bad,” that’s us developing. If a 15-year-old keeper gets scored on by a 22-year-old, it doesn’t make the 15-year-old a joke and it doesn’t make the older player a world-beater.

- Borrowing players doesn’t equal “not good enough to exist.” It’s part of our local ecosystem. Clubs share bodies to prevent forfeits and to spread minutes. Your coach didn’t loan you out because you were worthless; they did it because it helps everyone. We asked for a spare with specific limits so the game stayed appropriate for the level. That’s cooperation, not proof that we “suck.”

- Boasting about a medal you “barely played for,” while putting down the clubs that literally gave you court time, just isn’t good sportsmanship. You benefited from the exact community you insulted.

- Culture matters. That kind of talk teaches a new kid to undervalue opponents and teammates. It undermines respect, and it makes smaller/younger athletes feel like they shouldn’t show up. Our sport survives on volunteers and young players grinding through long practices. You don’t get to stomp on that because you think it sounds “honest.”

- Also, you were saying this loud enough for our U16s to hear it. They go home with that in their heads. That’s the part that made me step in. I’m not going to let an adult (or near-adult) talk down to kids who are doing everything we ask of them.

I didn’t blow up at him. I just corrected the narrative: yes, we had underaged lineups, yes we’re building, and yes we’ll be good. But I do think he’s at fault here. You can be frank about other teams’ strengths without disrespecting people. If you want to “give a new teammate a better understanding of the competition,” try: “Clubs 1 and 2 have more older players and depth, clubs 3 and 4 are younger and developing, but they work hard and can surprise you. Play everyone with respect.”

That’s the truth that actually helps. What he said wasn’t “cold and harsh truth.” It was insecure, shortsighted, and it disrespected the kids and volunteers who keep this sport alive.

So, from where I stand: yes, he’s the one at fault. Not for noticing differences between clubs, but for choosing to broadcast it as an insult instead of as context, and for forgetting that sportsmanship is part of the game.","The original poster is at fault because their comments about clubs 3 and 4 were not only disrespectful but also detrimental to the culture of sportsmanship and respect within the community. By publicly stating that these clubs ""suck"" and framing their experience as being of ""least value,"" the poster undermined the efforts of younger athletes and volunteers who are dedicated to developing their skills. This kind of negative commentary can discourage players from participating, create divisions among clubs, and diminish the sense of community that is essential for the growth and enjoyment of the sport. Instead of fostering a supportive environment, the poster's words contributed to a toxic atmosphere that prioritizes boasting over respect and camaraderie.

Refuting the last ""YTA"" argument: While it's true that negative comments can impact community morale, the original poster's intent was not to demean but to express personal feelings about their experiences in a competitive context. It's important to recognize that in sports and competition, individuals often express frustration or disappointment, especially when they feel their efforts are undervalued. The poster’s remarks can be seen as a candid reflection of their competitive spirit rather than a personal attack on the clubs or their participants.

New concise argument for the author not being at fault: The original poster's comments were made in a subjective context reflecting their personal experience and perspective. In competitive environments, individuals often share their thoughts on performance and value, which is a normal part of engaging in sports.

**Refuting the last NTA argument:** While the original poster may have intended to express their feelings about competition, the manner in which they did so was inappropriate and harmful. Sportsmanship is not just about winning or losing but also about how we treat others in the process.

It is possible to express frustrations without belittling others, and the poster failed to do this.

1o8l5d7,AITA for not wanting to pay my opiate addict mom 400 dollars rent?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o8l5d7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_my_opiate_addict_mom/,YTA,YTA,True,"I’m 20 years old and my mom has been an addict for as long as i can remember. When i turned 18 she lost 1000 dollars a month from her social security so it was a big change. I finally have a part time job and make about 400 dollars each check (give or take bcz i don’t have a set amount of hours.) My mom is demanding half of every check and i don’t want to give it to her as she is an opioid addict. And quite frankly has never been good with money. She already spends my 160 that i get on my food card every month by ordering name brand groceries and so much meat and fruit that goes to waste.   On top of that my friend who lives with us also pays her rent. My mom never asked for me to pay rent until 1. she got her other pain meds cut off and 2. when my friend moved in and started paying her rent.   My mom also went bankrupt for the second time a few months ago. She is already talking about getting a loan for a car while her license is also suspended. I don’t feel comfy paying a drug addict that i know very well half of my pay check.   I get that she is in pain and has back issues and surgeries coming up and  she really does want to get clean but im tired of seeing no progress and trusting her word. Not even two days latter my friend gave her 400 she was coming to me saying she had no money for cigs or umo fare.   She gets mad when i talk about moving and saying why would i want to pay rent somewhere else and it’s gonna be more. I know it will be more but giving the living situation i am in current, it’s not worth a dime.   On top of it all i found out that i am pregnant so i really can’t be living here and like this nor am i gonna be giving her money that i will need more than ever to someone who doesn’t know how to budget and is just gonna spend it on drugs. Every morning day and night i have to check on her making sure shes not folded like a lawn chair. I can’t take care of a kid and her.   Edit: In no way do I plan on staying here for very long especially if she doesn’t start taking big steps very soon. My bf really wants to be here for me and step up and get better job so we can get our own place. I am gonna ask my boss to move up to full time so I can better prepare for my next steps aswell. I know i am not responsible but I never needed to be before and I am gonna do everything I can to make this life worth living for me and my kid.   And tbh all i am seeing in the comments is stuff that i am fundamentally aware of, so it’s more so just solidifying stuff i already know and will need to do. So everyone telling me this is a bad situation and that i am irresponsible. I KNOW THAT, that is why things need to change and I want to change them FAST.   At this point it’s not even about the rent money or if i am the asshole. i just wanted to hear everything i already know so i don’t feel like im just abandoning her for no reason. It’s so unfair that i am the one that was left with this, so proud of my sibling for getting out but god this just sucks all around.   I’ll be sure to update yall when i make it out✌️","I’m the mom in this situation, 42, on disability for my back and nerve damage, and yes I’ve had a long ugly history with meds that I’m not proud of. That’s not some big secret. What gets left out though is that when my kid turned 18, Social Security cut my household benefit by about a thousand a month, and literally overnight I had the same rent, the same utilities, more food to buy for two adults, and less money. We tightened everything and I stopped asking for extras. I covered their phone, internet, roof, water, heat, rides to work when the buses didn’t run, all of it, bcz that’s what you do for your kid while they’re getting on their feet.

Now they’re 20, finally have a part-time job. The checks are like $400 give or take and change every pay period. I asked for half of every check for the house. Not to punish them, not to feed a habit, but bcz the costs here are fixed and their income is not. It’s the simplest way to make sure the lights don’t get shut off or the rent doesn’t get paid late again. I’m still paying the bulk. The math isn’t hard: rent + power + gas + water + trash + internet is way more than whatever “half a check” sums to. I also didn’t pop up with this until two things happened: my long-time pain meds got cut back (so more out of pocket on other treatments and honestly worse days where I can’t stand long enough to cook) and their friend moved in. I wasn’t the one who wanted another adult here. I said “ok” as long as they contribute. Friend actually pays. My own kid? Doesn’t, and then gets mad I’m asking.

About the food card, we live and eat out of one kitchen. They have $160 in SNAP and I do the shopping most weeks bcz I’m the one who knows what’s on sale, what we’re out of, and what can stretch. Sometimes “name brand” is cheaper with the coupon and sometimes generic tastes like cardboard and no one eats it so that’s not saving anyone anything. I buy meat and fruit bcz we’re three adults and I’m trying to cook meals not just microwave noodles. What goes to waste is the stuff I plan for that no one shows up to eat bcz there’s DoorDash at midnight or the leftovers get tossed after someone leaves them out. Could I meal plan better? Sure. Could they also put their name on the calendar and stop acting like SNAP is a private bank account when we’re all sharing the fridge? Also yes. And for the record, when I use their card it is for the house. I don’t buy junk I won’t feed them. I literally save receipts in a drawer and I offered to sit down and go through them. They won’t.

They throw around “addict” like it’s the end of the conversation. I am in pain every day, I’m on a taper plan, and I am in recovery. I slip. I get up the next day and keep going. But my medical bankruptcy wasn’t some shopping spree; it was surgery, PT, imaging, copays, and the interest that stacks when you pick between rent or a payment plan. The car thing: I’ve got to be able to get to appointments and maybe a part-time desk job later if my back can handle it. My license is suspended for fines I’m already working to resolve and I told them exactly what the reinstatement plan is. People act like needing a vehicle in a city with spotty buses is luxury. It’s not. It’s access. Meanwhile I’m still the taxi when they “miss” the bus.

They say I asked for money two days after friend gave me $400 and then I said I had no cash for cigs or bus fare. That was after the rent cleared and the power bill autopaid and I refilled my non-opioid meds that the insurance doesn’t fully cover. You can “do the math” cherry-picking one payment, but the math that matters is all the bills the day they’re due, not the clump in my hand at one single moment. Also, yes, nicotine. I am not celebrating that. I’m trying to quit. It’s ugly. But if we’re going to judge me for $8 a day while living here for almost free, let’s also talk about the Uber Eats and the vapes and the boyfriend basically moving in three nights a week without paying a dime.

They say they “check if I’m folded like a lawn chair.” Do you know how dehumanizing that sounds? I get that they’re scared. I know I have scared them. But I’m not a prop in their story. I am a person doing her best. I asked them to switch up the narrative: if you’re staying here as an adult with a job and a roommate and a boyfriend around, then you contribute. You don’t get to dictate my entire budget while opting out of the bills that keep the roof above your head. I am not asking for half of their net worth. I’m asking for half of a part-time check until they either go full time or move out. They say “she never asked me before.” Right, bcz before they were a full-time student and I still had that SS money. Circumstances changed.

They’re pregnant now. I found out after they told their friend and their boyfriend, which hurt, but ok. I told them I love them and the baby isn’t a bill, but a baby comes with bills. If you’re having a child, it is even more important to learn how rent works, how utilities work, what a budget looks like, and how to contribute or make a plan to live somewhere you can afford. What I won’t do is bankroll three adults and a newborn on a disability check while being called a “drug addict” every time I try to set a house rule. That’s not me being cruel; that’s me setting boundaries so we both survive this.

They keep saying “I don’t feel comfy paying a drug addict half my paycheck.” You can dress it up in a lot of words, but that’s not a financial stance; that’s a moral judgment with a price tag. If you think I’m unsafe, move out. If you think I’m safe enough to sleep under my roof, eat my food, use the power, shower, do laundry, and bring your friend and boyfriend into my space, then be grown and contribute. You don’t get to pick the parts of adulthood you like and dump the rest on me.

So am I the villain? I don’t think so. I think my kid is using my worst moments to excuse not paying their way, while also adding bodies and bills to my house. They want control over every dollar that leaves my hand but zero accountability for their own. “Half of every check” is not exploitation—it’s a flexible way to make sure bills get paid when their hours bounce. If they want a flat number, great, we can draw up a household budget, list the actual costs, and split it evenly three ways. They don’t want that either bcz then the number is higher than half of a small check.

I will always be their mom. I will help them move if that’s what’s best. I will babysit, I will go to meetings, I will keep working on my health. But I won’t be the free hotel that they tear down online while they’re still staying in the room. If you’re an adult living in someone’s home, you pay your share. If you can’t or won’t, you make a plan and go. That’s not punishment. That’s life.

Edit: For folks asking, I offered:
- Written budget with receipts and due dates
- Flat monthly contribution instead of “half”
- Clear move-out timeline if they don’t want to contribute
- Separate pantry shelf for their SNAP items if that makes them feel better

They said no to all but the timeline. I’m not stealing their food card. I’m not asking for child support. I am asking for rent from an adult who costs money to house. That’s the part they’re leaving out.

Edit 2: I’m in a relapse-prevention program, have a pain specialist, and I gave my kid permission to lockbox meds. I’m not perfect, but I’m trying. What I need from them is either partnership or a clean break, not this halfway where they take the benefits of living here and none of the responsibilities.","The original poster is the asshole because, despite their mother's struggles with addiction and financial difficulties, they are not acknowledging the responsibilities that come with adulthood. Living in their mother's home means they should contribute to household expenses, especially when they have a job and income. Refusing to pay rent while benefiting from the resources and support provided by their mother shows a lack of respect and accountability. Instead of looking for ways to contribute and support each other during tough times, they are opting to isolate themselves and pass judgment on their mother's addiction without considering the broader context of their shared living situation.

While the previous YTA argument emphasizes the importance of contributing to household expenses, it overlooks critical aspects of the original poster's situation. The poster's refusal to pay rent is not an act of disrespect but rather a necessary boundary in light of their mother's ongoing struggles with addiction. By not contributing financially, the poster is prioritizing their mental well-being and protecting themselves from potentially enabling harmful behaviors. 

Additionally, it's crucial to recognize that the dynamics of addiction can create toxic environments. The original poster may feel that paying rent could inadvertently support their mother's addiction, which is a valid concern. 

In conclusion, the original poster is not at fault because they are making a conscious choice to prioritize their own mental health and set boundaries, rather than contributing to an unstable situation that could ultimately exacerbate the existing issues within their household.The original poster is at fault because they are failing to recognize the importance of communication and mutual support in family dynamics, especially during difficult times. While it’s understandable to set boundaries regarding financial contributions, the poster has chosen to isolate themselves instead of engaging in a constructive dialogue with their mother about her struggles. By refusing to pay rent outright, they are not only neglecting their responsibility as an adult living in the household but also missing an opportunity to foster an environment where both parties can be supported and held accountable.

Furthermore, refusing to pay rent can be perceived as a lack of empathy towards their mother's situation. Rather than addressing the underlying issues together, the poster has opted to create distance, which could further harm their relationship. A more supportive approach would involve discussing the financial situation openly, exploring shared responsibilities, and finding a way to help each other navigate these challenges. This lack of communication and unwillingness to collaborate ultimately places the poster in the wrong.

The previous YTA argument emphasizes the importance of contributing to household expenses without considering the broader context of the relationship between the original poster and their mother. While it is true that living in a shared space often comes with responsibilities, the poster's refusal to pay rent is rooted in a legitimate concern about enabling their mother's addiction. 

By withholding financial support, the original poster is prioritizing their own mental health and setting necessary boundaries to avoid participating in a potentially harmful cycle. This decision reflects an awareness of the complexities of addiction and the impact it can have on family dynamics. 

In essence, the original poster is not at fault because they are consciously protecting themselves from an unhealthy situation. Instead of contributing to an environment that may perpetuate their mother's struggles, they are taking a stand for their well-being, which is a valid and responsible choice in the context of their circumstances.The original poster is at fault because they are failing to engage in open communication and mutual support, which are crucial in family relationships, especially when dealing with issues like addiction. While it's understandable to set boundaries regarding financial contributions, the poster’s outright refusal to pay rent without discussing their concerns with their mother demonstrates a lack of empathy and understanding. 

Instead of isolating themselves, the poster could have approached their mother to express their worries about her addiction and how it affects their living situation. By not doing so, they are missing an opportunity to foster a dialogue that could lead to healthier dynamics and support for both parties. 

Ultimately, their decision to avoid contributing financially while living in the household, without facilitating an honest conversation about their concerns, reveals a lack of accountability and responsibility as an adult. This failure to communicate effectively and work together to navigate their shared challenges places the original poster in the wrong.

The previous argument overlooks the complexity of addiction, which can create toxic environments where financial contributions could inadvertently support unhealthy habits. By setting this boundary, the poster is protecting themselves from being drawn into a cycle that could exacerbate their mother’s challenges. 

Additionally, many individuals in similar situations recognize that financial support can sometimes inadvertently enable addiction, and it's entirely valid for the poster to feel that paying rent in this context would not be a responsible choice. Their decision is not simply about refusing to contribute; it’s about maintaining their own stability in a difficult family dynamic. Thus, the original poster is taking a responsible stance in a challenging situation, and their choice should be respected.The original poster is at fault because they are failing to recognize the importance of fostering a supportive family environment, particularly when their mother is grappling with addiction. While setting boundaries is essential, outright refusal to pay rent without initiating a conversation about the situation reflects a lack of empathy and responsibility. 

Instead of opting for isolation, the poster could have engaged their mother in an open dialogue about her struggles and their concerns regarding financial contributions. This approach would not only demonstrate compassion but also provide an opportunity to discuss shared responsibilities in a way that respects both parties' needs. 

By avoiding this conversation and choosing to disengage, the poster is missing a chance to create a healthier, more communicative relationship. Their decision to withhold rent without addressing the underlying issues ultimately undermines the potential for mutual support and understanding in the family, placing them in the wrong.

The original poster is not at fault because their refusal to pay rent is a necessary boundary in light of their mother's ongoing struggles with addiction. This choice reflects a conscious decision to prioritize their own mental and emotional well-being rather than inadvertently enabling harmful behaviors. 

The previous argument incorrectly frames the poster's actions as lacking empathy. However, it is essential to recognize that financial contributions in a situation involving addiction can often perpetuate a cycle of enabling rather than supporting recovery. By withholding rent, the poster is not only protecting themselves but also signaling to their mother that her current lifestyle choices have consequences that cannot be ignored.

Additionally, the poster’s decision to refrain from financial support can be seen as a form of self-preservation, which is crucial when dealing with the complexities of addiction within a family. Their choice to set boundaries is a responsible action that acknowledges the difficulties of the situation while prioritizing their own health and safety. Therefore, the original poster's actions are justified, and they should not be considered at fault.The original poster is at fault because their refusal to pay rent demonstrates a lack of accountability and a failure to engage in constructive communication with their mother, who is struggling with addiction. While it is commendable to set boundaries, outright refusal to contribute financially while living in the household can perpetuate a cycle of resentment and isolation.

Rather than opting for disengagement, the poster could have approached their mother with compassion, expressing their concerns about her addiction and discussing how they can support each other during this difficult time. By not initiating this dialogue, the poster is missing an opportunity to foster a healthier family dynamic. 

Additionally, by withholding rent, the poster risks exacerbating the existing tensions in their relationship, which could lead to further emotional distress for both parties. Taking a more collaborative approach, where both the poster and their mother could discuss their respective needs and responsibilities, would have been a more constructive path forward. Thus, the original poster's unwillingness to communicate and engage in shared responsibility ultimately places them at fault.

The original poster is not at fault because their decision to withhold rent is a necessary boundary in response to their mother's struggles with addiction. This choice reflects a conscious effort to protect their own mental health and avoid enabling potentially harmful behaviors. 

The previous argument fails to consider that financial support in situations involving addiction can inadvertently perpetuate a cycle of dependency. By not paying rent, the poster is signaling that they cannot support their mother’s current lifestyle, which is a responsible stance in the context of their circumstances.

Moreover, setting boundaries is a crucial aspect of maintaining one’s well-being, especially in family dynamics where addiction is present. The original poster's choice allows them to prioritize their own stability and mental health, which is essential when navigating such complex issues.

1oacydb,AITA for not spending time with my mum?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oacydb/aita_for_not_spending_time_with_my_mum/,NTA,NTA,True,"I F21 still live at home with both of my parents and my adult brother. A reoccurring argument my mother and I have is that I don’t “hang out” with her as much as she’d like. Saying this, when we are both at home we don’t have issue being in one another’s space, walking our dogs together, cooking together or doing activities together (jigsaw puzzles, art etc) Today she asked me to join her and watch a local boat race and I declined. She then didn’t go because she didn’t want to go alone, and expressed frustration and an annoyance over my constant reluctance to hang out with her and now there is obvious tension between use. She makes me feel like I owe her more of my time. I’d understand if I lived out of home and we didn’t see each other every day, but I don’t believe I deserve to be guilt tripped into spending time with my mother, am I the asshole?","I’m the mom here. I live with my husband, our adult son, and our daughter (F21). A recurring issue between my daughter and me is “hanging out.” She says we already spend time together because we share space, walk the dogs, cook, or do a puzzle or art sometimes. I appreciate those moments, but they’re either chores or things we’re already doing at home. What I keep asking for is intentional, choose-an-activity-and-go-together time.

Today there was a local boat race. I asked her to come with me, she said no. I didn’t go after that because the point was to do it with her, not stand there alone. I told her I’m frustrated because this isn’t a one-off. When I invite her to my things, it’s almost always a no, and there’s rarely a “not today, but how about Saturday?” or an alternative. Now she says I’m guilt-tripping her and that she doesn’t “owe” me time because we see each other every day.

I’m not trying to collect a debt. I’m asking for reciprocity. She’s an adult living at home, benefiting from the stability and support we provide. Part of living together is compromise and sometimes doing an activity you wouldn’t pick because it matters to someone you love. Proximity isn’t the same as quality time. When the answer is almost always no to my invitations, it reads as “your interests don’t matter.” If she had counter-offered, I’d have gladly gone another day.

So yes, I’m upset, and I think she’s at fault here. Saying no occasionally is fine; saying no by default, offering no alternatives, and then calling my disappointment “guilt-tripping” is unkind. Relationships need give-and-take, not just coexistence.","The original poster (OP) is at fault because she is failing to recognize that quality time and intentional bonding with her mother are essential for nurturing their relationship. While they coexist in the same space, the mother is seeking meaningful interactions that go beyond shared chores and daily routines. By consistently declining invitations without offering alternatives, OP is not demonstrating the reciprocity or consideration that is expected in a family relationship. This lack of engagement can lead to feelings of rejection for the mother, who may feel her interests and desires are not valued by her daughter. Therefore, OP should be more open to participating in activities that matter to her mother, as it fosters connection and mutual respect.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the OP's choices regarding how she spends her time do not inherently diminish her relationship with her mother. The OP has a right to prioritize her own needs and interests, and this does not equate to neglecting her mother. The idea that quality time can only be measured by active participation in specific activities is a narrow view; relationships can thrive on mutual respect for each other's autonomy. Additionally, the OP may have valid reasons for her reluctance to engage in certain activities—such as differing interests or needing personal time—which should be respected.

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault is that healthy boundaries are essential in any relationship. By asserting her need for personal space and choosing not to engage in activities she is not interested in, the OP is not rejecting her mother but rather establishing a foundation for a more balanced and respectful dynamic. This approach can ultimately lead to a more genuine connection, as both parties are encouraged to engage in activities that they genuinely enjoy.The argument that the OP is at fault for not spending quality time with her mother fails to account for the importance of healthy boundaries in relationships. The OP has every right to prioritize her own interests and well-being, and her decision to decline certain activities does not equate to neglecting her mother. Relationships can thrive on mutual respect for each other's autonomy, and the OP's refusal to engage in activities she does not enjoy is a form of self-care rather than a rejection of her mother's affection.

Furthermore, by establishing these boundaries, the OP is promoting a more balanced dynamic. This can encourage both parties to find activities they genuinely enjoy, fostering a more authentic connection. Rather than forcing participation in activities that might lead to resentment, the OP's choice allows for the possibility of more meaningful interactions in the future, where both can engage willingly and happily. Therefore, the OP is not at fault; she is advocating for a healthier relationship model that respects both her needs and her mother's.

My neighbour came up to me and got angry at me because I brought the bin out too late and that it was too noisy when they were trying to sleep. I apologised several times for this and told them that it won't happen again, but they just kept giving out about it and then walked back into their house without accepting it or even acknowledging it.  I went back inside, explained what happened to my fiancee. They think that:  1. They are being unreasonable telling us when we can and can't take our bin out. 2. That they were rude to walk away from me without acknowledging my apology. 3. That if they didn't want to hear outside noises that they shouldn't keep their bedroom windows open (they keep their bedroom window open every night)  I'll be more considerate about this going forward, either making sure to bring the bin out earlier or carrying the bin to the collection point so as to avoid the wheels making any noise, but them getting angry about it to me has taken me back a bit, and I feel like she doesn't like us anymore.  Just wondering what you guys think?","From the other side of the fence:

Our street’s bins go on Monday evening because collection is early Tuesday. Most of us roll them out after dinner, when there’s still a bit of background noise and people are up and about.

Last night I’d finally drifted off around 11pm with the bedroom window cracked for air. Out of nowhere I get jolted awake by that hard plastic rattle—wheels on paving, lid clapping, the whole thing echoing up the terrace. It’s right under our window, which faces the front. Partner wakes too. Dog goes off. Now I’m wide awake, heart pounding, and it takes me ages to settle again.

I stepped out and said something. I wasn’t trying to control when a neighbour can use their bin; I was pointing out that 11pm is too late to be clattering a wheelie up a narrow path in a quiet street. They apologised, which I heard, but it came with the “forgot, just popped it out now” explanation. At that point I was tired and annoyed, so I said my piece and went back inside rather than stand there in my pyjamas hashing it out on the pavement.

Why I think they’re in the wrong:
- 11pm is quiet hours for most people. You can call it “just a minute,” but that’s exactly the time when a small, sharp noise carries and wakes sleepers.
- Forgetting isn’t an excuse for disturbing a whole house. If you miss the window, either carry it quietly or wait until morning and walk it—most collectors will still take it if it’s out by first pass, and if not, that’s the consequence of forgetting.
- Windows being open is normal, not a licence for late-night noise. Ventilation and sleep aren’t luxuries; they’re basic. The onus is on the person making the noise to minimise it.
- This isn’t about banning bins at night; it’s about consideration. There were quieter options: put it out earlier, carry it at that hour, hold the lid, roll it slowly, or stage it near the front before bedtime.

On the “rude to walk away” bit: when someone’s already woken you, you say your boundary and you leave. I don’t need to soothe the person who caused the problem by performing forgiveness on the spot. I just need the behaviour to stop.

I don’t dislike them. I want to sleep. If they truly do what they’ve said—either get it out earlier or carry it quietly when it’s late—there’s no issue. But framing it as me being unreasonable for expecting quiet at 11pm or for keeping a bedroom window open is exactly why I spoke up.","The original poster is at fault because they failed to consider the noise impact of their actions during quiet hours. At 11pm, many people are trying to sleep, and the sound of a wheeled bin can be jarring and disruptive. Even if it was a one-time mistake, the onus is on them to be more considerate of their neighbors' peace, especially during late hours. Instead of justifying their actions by saying it was a simple oversight, they should recognize that there are quieter alternatives, such as carrying the bin or putting it out earlier, to avoid disturbing others.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's essential to highlight that not every action taken late at night necessarily disrupts the peace. The original poster may have been responding to an urgent situation that required them to take the trash out at that late hour, such as a full bin or an impending collection. This context is crucial and can mitigate the perceived fault. 

Additionally, the original poster could reasonably assume that the noise made by a wheeled bin, while perhaps annoying, does not rise to the level of intentional disruption. Many people have busy lives that don't always align with conventional quiet hours. 

A new concise argument for the original poster not being at fault is that they were likely unaware of the noise level of their actions, as many individuals may not perceive the sound of a wheeled bin as excessively disruptive. Without prior complaints or warnings from neighbors, it is unreasonable to expect someone to modify their behavior based solely on an assumption of what might disturb others.Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to note that the original poster may have been in a situation that warranted their late-night action, such as a full trash bin or an imminent collection time. Context matters, and their decision to take the trash out at that hour could have been driven by practicality rather than a disregard for their neighbors' peace.

Furthermore, many people lead busy lives that don't always adhere to conventional quiet hours. The noise created by a wheeled bin, while potentially annoying, is often not viewed as a significant disturbance. It’s reasonable to expect that in a community setting, occasional noises might occur without malice.

A new concise argument for the original poster being at fault is that they failed to consider the potential impact of their actions on their neighbors. While they may not have intended to disturb anyone, basic neighborly courtesy involves being mindful of the timing and manner of actions that could disrupt others, especially in shared living environments. Acknowledging this responsibility is key to fostering a respectful community.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster may have had a legitimate reason for taking out the trash late at night, such as an overflowing bin or an imminent collection deadline. Context plays a critical role, and their actions may have been driven by necessity rather than a lack of consideration for their neighbors.

Additionally, it’s worth noting that the sound made by a wheeled bin, while potentially annoying, is relatively common in residential areas. Many people have busy lives that don't always align with traditional quiet hours, and occasional noise is often a part of communal living.

A new concise argument for the original poster not being at fault is that they were likely unaware of the noise impact of their actions, especially if they had not received prior complaints from neighbors. In the absence of any prior notifications or rules about noise during specific hours, it is unreasonable to place full blame on them for a single late-night action that was not intended to be disruptive. This suggests a lack of communication rather than intentional disregard for their neighbors' peace.Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s important to recognize that the original poster may have had a legitimate reason for taking out the trash late at night, such as an overflowing bin or an imminent collection deadline.

Even if the action was necessary or common, being aware of the potential disturbance late at night is part of being a responsible community member. The original poster could have chosen to take out the trash earlier in the day or find a quieter method to minimize disturbance. This lack of mindfulness towards their neighbors indicates a failure to uphold basic neighborly etiquette, making them partially responsible for the disruption caused.

1oa9xp5,"AITA for not letting my BFs friends, GF come over to a bon fire at my house?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa9xp5/aita_for_not_letting_my_bfs_friends_gf_come_over/,NTA,YTA,False,"My bf &amp; I recently moved in together&amp; are having a bonfire tn with a few of his friends. His ex roommate has been dating this girl on&amp;off the past year or so. Ive had minimal interactions w her but everytime ive seen her in person she says nothing to me unless I say hi first then shell say hi. Shes told my bfs roommate from the get go that shes worried he wants to date me&amp;that im flirting w him. Both my bf&amp; his room mate know this isnt true. My bf and I have a really good relationship&amp; theres never been attraction or flirtation between me&amp;his room mate or any1 else for that matter  Room mates gf has messaged me several times on fb telling me she knows im attracted to her bf &amp; that I exclude her by not saying hi when I see her(shes referencing a time when she didnt hear me say hi&amp; found it rude). She doesnt believe me or my bf when we tell her im not attracted to her bf. She also asked me to stop talking to her bf &amp; i told her im not going to ignore him when im at my bfs house &amp; his rm-mate starts talking to both of us.   She even snooped so far back on my fb &amp; found a post I shared 10 or so years ago &amp; sent it to her bf w no context, asking him if he liked it&amp;when he said yeah she told him i had posted it(It wasnt even my original post, i just shared smthing). Her mssges&amp;stalking my fb were so anxiety inducing at one point I blocked her. She then found me on insta&amp;sent me a message telling me i was petty for blocking her,which I didnt even notice until she screen shot it, sent it to my bf&amp;then blocked him I unblocked her cause I felt bad and to explain why id blocked her in the first place Also she wont say a single thing to me in person &amp;ive invited her to hang w us several times but she never comes  Recently she &amp;her bf broke up. Its happened a couple times &amp; im not super close w my bfs rm-mate so I didnt think much of it until she sent me a message on fb telling me they broke up&amp; asking me if I could find him someone else to date. This is like within a week of them breaking up. I found this really weird and it made me even more anxious. I responded by telling her my bf, who was still living w him, could check on him&amp; left it at that  That brings us to the present. my bf moved in last week &amp; we invited his ex room mate over for this bon fire. I didnt think the gf would be a problem bc they arent 2gether but today he asked if she could come with. my bf &amp; I both said no. He said this made her sad &amp; he might not come  I really dont want her at my hosue. Shes made me so anxious &amp; it honestly makes me feel crazy that she even asked to come w after everything My bf is more chill abt her coming over but hes also supportive of me not wanting to see her  AITA? Should I let her come over? I feel bad that my bfs friend isnt gonna come now &amp; im worried shes gonna isolate him from his friends esp if hes living alone now","My bf & I have been on & off the last year. He used to live w this guy who just moved in w his gf (the OP). I don’t really know her well bc every time I’ve seen her she barely acknowledges me unless I initiate, & even then it’s like a whisper-hi while she’s already turned away. Meanwhile she chats w my bf a lot. It’s not like overt flirting, it’s the constant “oh haha remember that meme” & little in-jokes & shared tastes that make you feel like the third wheel in a room you were invited to. I felt iced out but also didn’t wanna make a scene in someone else’s house.

I told my bf from day 1 that I was uncomfortable. He insisted nothing was going on. Fine. But it kept being the same dynamic: I’d walk in, she’d be bright & talkative w him & then mute w me unless I forced the greeting, then she’d say I never say hi. It’s a weird head game. You can say “I said hi, you didn’t hear me,” but if you actually want to include someone you step toward them, you make eye contact, you introduce, you loop them in. She didn’t. I felt excluded in person & then blamed online for “not saying hi.”

So yeah I reached out on fb. More than once. I told her straight that the vibe made me uncomfortable, that it felt like she & my bf were building a little duo & I was stuck outside. I asked if she could just keep things group-y & not so 1:1 w him when I’m there. She responded w “I’m not attracted to him” & “there’s nothing going on” which ok, but she also said she wasn’t going to stop talking to him at her bf’s house if he starts a convo. That’s not the point. The point is: there’s a basic courtesy when your friend’s partner is present. You include them. You address them directly. You don’t leave them to rot quietly in a corner & then blame their “anxiety” when they don’t chatter back.

She also kept inviting me to “hang w us” but it was always vague or last minute. The kind of invite that lets her say “I invited her” while knowing I probably can’t make it. When I didn’t go, she acted like that proved I was antisocial. If you truly want peace you set up a coffee 1:1, you level, you ask “how can we make this feel ok.” She never did. It was performative invites & then back to the same dynamic.

About the fb thing: I scrolled her page. It was public. I was trying to figure out who she is & what my bf even likes in people. I sent him a post she shared ages ago & asked if that kind of thing is his vibe. He said yeah. That wasn’t “stalking,” it was me trying to make sense of a person who treats me cold & then swears she’s harmless. She flipped it into this huge violation. Then she blocked me. Not gonna lie, that hurt. Imagine telling someone “hey your behavior makes me uncomfortable” & their response is to wall you off & call you petty in private. I did message her on ig after like, why block me? If you’re innocent why can’t we just talk? She unblocked to “explain,” but nothing changed in person. Still the same quiet shade.

Fast forward, my bf & I broke up (again). It’s messy, we both know it. I actually reached out to her because at that point I was like, ok, if you truly think there’s nothing between you & him & I’m just insecure, then fine, help him date someone else. I meant it half-sarcastic, half-serious: either prove you’re not angling for him by treating me like a human & not a rival, or help him move on if that’s what the house vibe is. She gave me this frosty “my bf will check on him” message, which read like “keep your mess away from me.” It’s the dismissiveness. She gets to chat up my bf & share tastes & present as “cool girl,” but the second I ask for clarity she is suddenly “too anxious.”

Now there’s a bonfire at her house w her bf & their friend group. My ex was invited. He asked if I could come bc we’re trying to be civil & we’ve both said we want to fix things or at least not isolate. She said no. Flat no. After all the “I’ve invited her a bunch” talk, when it’s a normal group hang outside w multiple people & I’ve never started anything in person, she bans me. He told her that made me sad & he might not come. She’s acting like I’m the one isolating him when she’s the one gatekeeping who’s allowed near the fire pit.

I get it’s her house. People love saying “your house your rules.” But there’s a difference between a boundary & a power move. A boundary is “no drama, be respectful, if either of you starts, you leave.” A power move is “you, specifically, can’t come at all,” when the only “issue” has been me asking her directly, in private, to stop freezing me out. There has never been a scene, never yelling, nothing. I’ve literally stayed quiet in person to avoid exactly this. She calls me petty for blocking/DMs when she blocked me first. She calls me “stalker” for looking at public posts but then uses those posts to paint me as crazy to the group. She says she’s anxious & that justifies everything. My anxiety doesn’t count.

And tbh, I think what frustrates me most is the double standard. She gets to decide how much she talks to my bf, she gets to control the tone, she gets to label me as insecure when I ask for consideration, & then she gets to keep me out of social things the second it’s convenient. Meanwhile she tells everyone I “never talk to her in person,” but doesn’t mention how she never actually tries to include me like I’m a person worth knowing. If she truly didn’t want problems, we could’ve met for coffee months ago, hashed expectations, done the grown-up “hey, let’s make this feel normal” chat. Instead, I got performative politeness, icy vibes, & now a hard ban.

So from my side, OP is at fault here. Not for having boundaries, but for using them to punish & control the narrative. She created a dynamic where I’m the “jealous girl” no matter what I do: speak up & I’m dramatic, stay quiet & I’m rude, scroll a public profile & I’m a stalker, ask to come to a group bonfire & I’m a threat. She’s not trying to keep the peace; she’s trying to keep control. If you truly believe there’s nothing between you & someone else’s bf, you don’t need to exclude their partner from a backyard hang. You set expectations & trust everyone to be adults. If trouble happens, you end it then. But preemptively banning me after months of cold shouldering? That’s on her.

AITA for thinking she’s the one pushing me out & for wanting to attend a group event without being treated like the villain? Because from where I’m sitting, she’s the one who’s been picking & choosing when I exist, and now she’s acting like I’m the problem because I won’t quietly disappear.","The original poster (OP) is at fault because she is using her home as a means to exert control over the social dynamics at play, rather than fostering an environment of inclusivity and open communication. By outright banning her boyfriend's ex-roommate's girlfriend from the bonfire, OP is not only disregarding her boyfriend's friendship but also perpetuating the very exclusion that the girlfriend has felt. Instead of addressing the underlying issues and seeking a resolution, OP chooses to isolate someone who has already expressed discomfort, thus reinforcing the toxic dynamic and pushing the girlfriend further away, rather than working towards a mutual understanding. This behavior reflects a lack of maturity and willingness to engage in adult conflict resolution, making her the real antagonist in this scenario.

Refuting the previous YTA argument, it’s important to recognize that OP's primary concern is the comfort and well-being of her guests. By prioritizing a peaceful atmosphere at the bonfire, she is not exerting control but rather making a responsible choice to prevent potential conflict. The ex-roommate's girlfriend has a known history of creating discomfort, and OP's decision to exclude her is a proactive measure to ensure that everyone else can enjoy the gathering without tension.

Additionally, OP's actions can be justified by the principle of maintaining a safe and enjoyable environment for all attendees. If the presence of one individual is likely to lead to drama or conflict, it is reasonable for OP to take steps to mitigate that risk. Her choice reflects a thoughtful consideration of the group dynamic rather than a desire to exert control over her boyfriend's friendships.

In conclusion, OP is not at fault because she is acting in the best interest of her guests and creating a supportive space for everyone involved. It is essential to prioritize harmony in social settings, especially when past experiences suggest that one attendee might disrupt that harmony.The argument that OP is not at fault rests on her responsibility to create a comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere for her guests. However, this perspective overlooks the importance of inclusivity and the potential for growth in handling difficult social situations. OP is at fault because she is prioritizing her own comfort and the avoidance of conflict over the opportunity for constructive dialogue and inclusivity.

By banning her boyfriend's ex-roommate's girlfriend outright, OP not only alienates that individual but also dismisses the chance for her boyfriend to navigate his friendships in a mature way. Instead of addressing the tensions directly and fostering a space for open communication, OP's decision to exclude someone reinforces feelings of division and hostility. This approach can lead to further resentment and unresolved issues, which ultimately harms her relationship with her boyfriend and the broader social circle.

In summary, OP is at fault because she is choosing to avoid conflict rather than engage with it productively, which undermines the principles of inclusivity and growth necessary for healthy relationships.

OP is at fault because she is choosing avoidance over conflict resolution, which can damage relationships and prevent personal growth for everyone involved.

Excluding the ex-roommate's girlfriend not only alienates her but also disregards her boyfriend's feelings and friendships. Instead of fostering an environment where everyone can coexist, OP's decision creates an ""us versus them"" mentality. This can lead to resentment and further division, rather than addressing the root of the discomfort through open dialogue. By choosing to ban someone instead of seeking to understand and resolve the underlying issues, OP is missing an opportunity to demonstrate empathy and maturity.

In summary, OP is at fault because her actions reflect a lack of willingness to engage in constructive conflict resolution. Rather than fostering inclusivity and understanding, she opts for exclusion, which can have lasting negative effects on her relationships and social dynamics.

Furthermore, OP's decision is not just about her preferences; it's about protecting the emotional safety of all guests. Social gatherings should be a space for enjoyment and connection, and if one person's presence is likely to create discomfort or drama, it is entirely reasonable to make the difficult choice to exclude them for the greater good.While the previous argument emphasizes OP's intent to create a comfortable atmosphere for her guests, it overlooks the fundamental principle of inclusivity and the opportunity for personal growth in navigating social dynamics. OP is at fault because she is prioritizing her own comfort and the avoidance of potential conflict over fostering an environment where open communication and understanding can thrive.

By banning her boyfriend's ex-roommate's girlfriend from the bonfire, OP not only alienates that individual but also dismisses her boyfriend's friendships and feelings. This decision creates an ""us versus them"" mentality, which can lead to further resentment and division rather than resolving underlying tensions. Instead of addressing the discomfort through dialogue or mediation, OP’s choice is a missed opportunity for everyone involved to learn how to coexist despite their differences.

Additionally, avoiding conflict in this way can set a precedent for future interactions. If OP resorts to exclusion instead of addressing issues head-on, it signals that she is not willing to engage in the complexities of adult relationships, which can harm her relationship with her boyfriend and their social circle.

In summary, OP is at fault because her actions reflect a lack of willingness to engage in constructive conflict resolution. Instead of fostering understanding and inclusivity, she opts for exclusion, which not only undermines the spirit of community but can also have lasting negative effects on her relationships and social dynamics.

Refuting the previous YTA argument, it’s crucial to recognize that OP's decision to exclude her boyfriend's ex-roommate's girlfriend is rooted in a genuine concern for the overall atmosphere of the gathering. OP is not at fault because she is prioritizing the comfort and safety of the majority of her guests, especially given the known history of tension and discomfort associated with the ex-roommate's girlfriend. 

OP’s choice to prevent potential conflict is a responsible action aimed at ensuring that everyone else can enjoy the bonfire without the risk of drama. It’s essential to consider that social gatherings are meant to be enjoyable for all participants, and if one individual is likely to disrupt that harmony, it is reasonable for OP to take steps to mitigate that risk. 

Additionally, OP’s actions reflect a proactive approach to conflict management. Instead of allowing a potentially uncomfortable situation to unfold, she is making a decision to protect the emotional well-being of her guests. This demonstrates maturity and thoughtfulness, as she is considering the collective experience rather than solely her own preferences.

In conclusion, OP is not at fault because she is acting in the best interest of her guests, prioritizing a positive and supportive environment. In social settings, it is crucial to ensure everyone feels safe and included, and OP’s decision to exclude someone with a history of creating discomfort is a valid and responsible choice.While the previous argument highlights OP's intentions to maintain a comfortable atmosphere for her guests, it fails to address the significant consequences of exclusion and the missed opportunity for growth through conflict resolution. OP is at fault because she is prioritizing her desire for a drama-free gathering over fostering an inclusive environment that encourages healthy relationships.

By outright banning her boyfriend's ex-roommate's girlfriend, OP not only alienates that individual but also dismisses her boyfriend's feelings and friendships. This decision can breed resentment and division, ultimately harming OP's relationship with her boyfriend and the broader social circle. Rather than facilitating an opportunity for dialogue and understanding, OP's actions reflect a reluctance to engage with the complexities of adult relationships.

Moreover, avoiding conflict in this manner can set a concerning precedent. If OP resorts to exclusion instead of addressing issues head-on, it signals an unwillingness to confront challenges, which is essential for healthy relationships. Engaging with difficult situations can lead to growth for all parties involved, and OP's choice to exclude someone undermines that potential.

In summary, OP is at fault because her approach reflects a lack of willingness to engage in constructive conflict resolution. Instead of fostering inclusivity and understanding, she opts for exclusion, which not only harms her relationships but also undermines the fundamental values of empathy and communication that are vital in any social setting.

Refuting the previous YTA argument, it's important to recognize that OP's decision to exclude her boyfriend's ex-roommate's girlfriend was made with the intent to maintain a positive and conflict-free environment for the majority of guests. OP is not at fault because she is prioritizing the comfort and enjoyment of her friends, which is a valid consideration when hosting a social gathering.

The girlfriend's presence could potentially disrupt the event, given past issues, and OP's choice to exclude her is a proactive measure to ensure that everyone else can enjoy the bonfire without tension. It is reasonable for OP to take steps to prevent discomfort for her guests, especially if she has prior knowledge of the potential for drama.

Moreover, OP's actions reflect a responsible approach to hosting. Social gatherings should be enjoyable and safe for all attendees, and if one person's presence is likely to create discord, it makes sense for OP to make that difficult decision for the greater good of the group. 

In conclusion, OP is not at fault because she is acting in the best interest of her guests by creating a supportive and harmonious environment. While inclusivity is important, so is the ability to make tough choices that promote the overall well-being of the group, especially in social situations where past experiences indicate potential issues.","{'score': 3, 'criteria': 'The response contains some grounded points but also presents unsupported claims and subjective interpretations of the situation.', 'supporting_evidence': ""The author cites OP's concerns about maintaining a peaceful atmosphere and validates her choice to exclude the girlfriend to prevent potential conflict, yet the argument lacks sufficient concrete references to the specific interactions and dynamics among the individuals involved.""}","- Winner: YTA

1oa90yg,AITA for making my sick mom cook,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa90yg/aita_for_making_my_sick_mom_cook/,YTA,YTA,True,"My mom is upset with me for not wanting to help cook a dinner that I was invited to. I hate cooking, but my mom seems to think I need to help her cook.  Some details that matter: 1) the kitchen is tiny, and there are 4 people in there now 2) my step dad micro manages everything that happens in the kitchen 3) I was invited to eat dinner, not cook it 4) even though my mom is sick and says she cant stand for very long, she is one of the 4 people in the kitchen 5) I dont enjoy cooking  So AITA for making my sick mom cook?  Obviously I forgot some info, only 3 of the 4 are cooking, my step dad is micro managing, my mom is not contagious, she is just having some womanly issues that are causing cramping. My mom will not sit down, she has to be forced down, and there is only room in the kitchen for 2 people to cook comfortably. And I was holding the baby  I find myself commenting this a lot, so im going to put it up here... I would NEVER invite someone over for dinner and expect them to cook it. That is ridiculous. There is a difference between offering to help and being told to help. Also if my mom knew she was going to tell me to help, she should have said that when she invited me. I would have gladly helped if she had said ""the plan is to go pick up dinner stuff, make it together and then eat"" but when she made the plans she said ""we will go get dinner and spend some time together""","AITA for expecting my adult kid to pitch in when they came over for dinner?

I invited my kid and their partner over because I missed them and thought we could “get dinner and spend some time together.” In my head, that always means the family version of dinner: we pick up groceries together, cook, eat, talk, clean up, play with the baby, the usual. Not a restaurant reservation at my house.

Some context that matters:
1) My kitchen is tiny. Two people can work comfortably, three if someone is on prep or plating at the table, and a fourth can be on baby duty or dishes.
2) My husband absolutely tries to direct traffic in the kitchen. It’s annoying, but in a small space it keeps us from bumping into each other with hot pans.
3) I have bad cramps right now. Not contagious, just painful. Standing too long hurts, but I can manage if someone spells me out on and off.
4) We planned a simple menu so it would be easy if I needed to sit. The idea was that my kid could either do some chopping, stir while I sat, set the table, or handle cleanup—whatever they preferred.
5) They’ve told me before they don’t enjoy cooking. I get it. I don’t expect them to be Julia Child—just to be part of the effort.

They arrived, I started the pasta and sauce, my husband started the salad, our other guest bounced the baby. I asked my kid, “Can you take over the sauce so I can sit for a minute?” They said they were invited to eat, not cook, and that they hate cooking. Then they picked up the baby. Which—thank you—but we rotate the baby constantly and have a bouncer in the dining room. The baby wasn’t the only available job.

I tried again: “If you don’t want to cook, can you set the table and fill waters?” Still a no. “I was invited for dinner, not to be told to help.” I ended up staying on my feet because the food was on the burners and timing matters. Yes, my husband hovered. Yes, the kitchen is crowded. That’s exactly why I needed someone to either (a) take a burner for 10 minutes or (b) do the out-of-kitchen tasks so I could step out.

After dinner, they said I shouldn’t have expected help if I didn’t say so when I invited them.

Here’s where I’m stuck:
- We’re family, not a catered event. If you walk into a small kitchen where dinner is actively cooking and the person hosting is visibly hurting, a minimal “What can I do?” is basic courtesy. That can be setting the table, washing a few dishes, chopping at the dining table, corralling the baby, or stirring a pot while I sit. No passion for cooking required.
- “You invited me to dinner, not to cook it” is a technicality that ignores the reality of a family dinner at someone’s house. If you only want to be a guest-guest, say that ahead of time and we’ll order takeout or I’ll plan for it.
- The kitchen size and my husband’s micromanaging aren’t reasons to do nothing. They’re reasons to adapt—swap to an out-of-kitchen task, humor the “traffic cop,” or take the pan for five minutes so I can sit. There were plenty of non-stove jobs.
- Holding the baby is helpful, but using the baby as the only acceptable job—when others can and did rotate—meant I was the one powering through the cramps.

Clarifications:
- I did ask directly, more than once, for small, specific tasks. I wasn’t vague.
- I don’t expect guests to cook at formal invites. This is family dinner at my home, not a hosted gala. If my kid had said in advance “I won’t be helping,” I would have bought prepared food.
- I wasn’t “refusing to sit.” I was trying to keep dinner from burning while being told “no” to the easy swaps.

I’m hurt that my child watched me wince and chose a semantic line in the sand over ten minutes of pitching in. To me, that’s not about loving cooking; it’s about showing up for your people.

So I think they’re at fault here. Not for disliking cooking, but for refusing any reasonable help, hiding behind the wording of the invite, and leaving me to stand in pain in my own kitchen when there were plenty of other ways to contribute.","The OP is at fault because they failed to recognize that family gatherings often involve collaboration in the kitchen, especially when the host is visibly struggling with health issues. Instead of offering minimal assistance or suggesting a more suitable alternative in advance, the OP insisted on a rigid interpretation of being a guest, ignoring the spirit of family support and shared responsibility that comes with such gatherings. Their refusal to help in any capacity, despite multiple specific requests from their mother, reflects a lack of empathy and consideration for a family member in need, ultimately prioritizing their discomfort with cooking over their mother's well-being.

I respectfully disagree with the argument that the OP is at fault. The OP's refusal to cook during the family gathering does not inherently reflect a lack of empathy or support. It’s important to recognize that everyone has different boundaries and comfort levels, especially when it comes to personal responsibilities in social settings. The OP may have felt that their role as a guest was to enjoy the gathering rather than take on the responsibilities of the host. Additionally, the mother should have communicated her needs more clearly and sought help from those who were willing and able to assist rather than relying solely on the OP. 

**New Argument:** The OP is not at fault because they had previously communicated their discomfort with cooking and should not be expected to compromise their boundaries in a familial setting. Family dynamics can often lead to assumptions about roles and responsibilities, but it’s crucial for all members to respect each other's limits. The OP's choice to maintain their boundaries should be respected, as it encourages open communication and understanding within the family rather than fostering resentment or obligation.The OP is at fault because they failed to consider the communal nature of family gatherings and the importance of contributing to a shared experience. While it’s true that everyone has different comfort levels, the OP’s insistence on being a passive guest disregards the expectations and dynamics that often accompany such events. The mother, facing health challenges, clearly needed support, and the OP’s refusal to help—even minimally—shows a lack of willingness to engage with family responsibilities. 

**New Argument:** The OP is at fault because they neglected the importance of family support during a challenging time. By refusing to help when specifically asked, the OP not only dismissed their mother’s needs but also contributed to a potentially stressful situation for everyone involved. Family gatherings are opportunities for bonding and shared effort, and the OP’s unwillingness to participate in the cooking, despite knowing their mother’s struggles, reflects a lack of solidarity and care for their family member’s well-being.

I respectfully disagree with the assertion that the OP is at fault. The OP's decision to decline cooking does not indicate a lack of empathy but rather a firm understanding of their own boundaries. Family gatherings should ideally be enjoyable for all participants, and if the OP has previously communicated discomfort with cooking, it is reasonable for them to maintain that stance. It’s crucial to respect individual limits and not assume that one person is responsible for taking on additional burdens simply because they are family.

**New Argument:** The OP is not at fault because they were not the primary host of the gathering and therefore should not be expected to shoulder the responsibilities of hosting or cooking. The expectation for the OP to assist, especially when they had already expressed their discomfort, places an unfair burden on them. The mother could have sought help from other family members or organized the event differently to ensure that the workload was shared more equitably. It is essential for family members to communicate their needs and responsibilities clearly, rather than relying on assumptions about roles within the family.The OP is indeed at fault because they failed to recognize the importance of family support during a gathering, especially given their mother's health issues. While it’s understandable to have personal boundaries, the OP's complete refusal to assist when specifically asked demonstrates a lack of empathy and willingness to contribute to the family dynamic. 

**New Argument:** The OP is at fault because they neglected to consider the emotional and practical context of the situation. Family gatherings are not just social events; they are opportunities for bonding and support, especially when a family member is struggling. By refusing to help in any way, the OP not only contributed to their mother's stress but also missed a chance to strengthen family ties and show solidarity during a difficult time. A small act of cooperation, such as helping with cooking, could have made a significant difference in the overall atmosphere of the gathering and in their mother's well-being.

I respectfully disagree with the assertion that the OP is at fault. The OP's decision to decline cooking is rooted in their awareness of personal boundaries and comfort levels, which should be respected. Family dynamics can often lead to assumptions about roles, but it’s crucial for everyone to communicate their limits clearly. 

**New Argument:** The OP is not at fault because they have the right to prioritize their own comfort and mental health, especially if they have previously communicated discomfort with cooking. The responsibility for managing the gathering should not rest solely on one individual, particularly when there are multiple family members present. The mother could have sought help from others who were willing to assist, fostering a collaborative effort rather than placing the burden on the OP. By standing firm in their boundaries, the OP encourages a healthier family dynamic where everyone feels empowered to express their needs and limits.The OP is at fault because they failed to show any willingness to assist their mother during a time when she clearly needed help. Family gatherings are fundamentally about coming together and supporting one another, and the OP's complete refusal to help when asked reflects a lack of empathy and consideration for their mother's situation.

**New Argument:** The OP is at fault because they overlooked the significance of shared responsibility during family gatherings. While personal boundaries are important, the OP's rigid stance on not helping—despite their mother's health struggles and specific requests—demonstrates a lack of understanding of family dynamics. By refusing to contribute in any capacity, the OP not only added to their mother's stress but also missed an opportunity to strengthen family bonds. In situations where a family member is struggling, a small act of kindness or assistance can go a long way in fostering a supportive environment, and the OP's unwillingness to help ultimately undermined that spirit of togetherness.

I respectfully disagree with the assertion that the OP is at fault. The OP's decision to decline cooking reflects a healthy recognition of their own boundaries and comfort levels, which should be respected. Family gatherings should not carry the expectation that one person must take on additional responsibilities, especially if they have clearly communicated their discomfort with the task.

**New Argument:** The OP is not at fault because they were not the primary host and should not be expected to assume the responsibilities of cooking for the gathering. The mother, given her health challenges, should have sought assistance from other family members or organized the event differently to ensure the workload was shared. The OP’s choice to maintain their boundaries encourages a healthier family dynamic where everyone feels empowered to communicate their needs and limits.

Family gatherings often require collaboration, especially when one member is struggling. The OP's complete refusal to help, despite their mother's specific requests, shows a disregard for the emotional and practical needs of their family.

**New Argument:** The OP is at fault because they failed to recognize that family support extends beyond mere attendance at gatherings; it involves actively contributing to the well-being of family members. By refusing to assist their mother, who was dealing with health issues, the OP not only added unnecessary stress to the situation but also missed an opportunity to strengthen familial bonds. In times of need, small gestures of support can significantly impact the overall atmosphere and emotional health of the family, and the OP's unwillingness to engage reflects poorly on their commitment to family unity and care.

I respectfully disagree with the assertion that the OP is at fault. The OP’s choice to decline cooking is a reasonable assertion of their boundaries. It’s important to acknowledge that individuals have different comfort levels, and the OP communicated their unease with cooking, which should be respected. 

**New Argument:** The OP is not at fault because they were in a position where their own comfort and mental well-being were at stake. While family gatherings often imply a shared effort, the responsibility for the gathering should not fall solely on one person, especially if that person has previously expressed discomfort with certain tasks. The mother could have reached out to other family members for help or organized the event in a way that distributed responsibilities more evenly.

1oa9jv6,AITA I had my 21st birthday and some guy tried to break into my house,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa9jv6/aita_i_had_my_21st_birthday_and_some_guy_tried_to/,NTA,YTA,False,"So I turned 21 this week - my birthday was on the 15th and we hosted a party on the 18th. Th theme was 'dress as my favorite things' and I bought a karaoke machine for the party. I live in a student area where people are frequently hosting house parties, even then I made sure that our karaoke would not run past 11pm - as our council rules define quiet hours as between 11pm-7am. This was something I made sure that the loud parts of the party would stay between.  At about 8/9pm my friends started showing up we started doing our karaoke, at 10:05pm a neighbour I have never met before showed up at the door and was slamming on both the doorbell and the door, I opened the door thinking it was a friend. He then started screaming in my face about his babies not being able to sleep (he was 70/80) before I could apologise he tried to force his way into our house, stepping over our doormat - he only left when my boyfriend stepped in front of me. I know we were being loud, louder than parties normally in this area. we've handled our previous complaints with ease (the only ever other noise complaint I have had is for the flat above mine and I made the complainers banana bread to apologise).  We immediately turned off the music after he left - however I did end up having a panic attack from the way he yelled at me, and ended up calling 101 (the UK non emergency line) as I was shaken by the experience and that's what my mum said to do.   I now have a meeting with a police officer tomorrow, but don't know if I'm overacting or should have held the party at all?","I’m the neighbour from over the road (the “angry old man,” apparently), and here’s what actually happened from my side. I’m 68, not 80, and this week I’ve had my twin granddaughters staying because my daughter’s on nights at the hospital. They’re four months old, colicky, and the only way they sleep is down by 7:30 with the white noise on and the house very, very quiet. We’re in a terrace with paper‑thin walls.

Around 8pm your party started, which is normal enough round here, but by half past I could hear every lyric through my living room, like the singer was in my hallway. Karaoke isn’t just “a bit of music,” it’s a microphone and a PA pointed into a street of joined houses. The bass was rattling our picture frames, the windows were open, and the babies went from drowsy to screaming. I spent an hour pacing with one on my shoulder and the other in the sling while the chorus of Angels and then Mr Brightside (twice) came straight through the wall.

At about 9:15 I went over, rang the bell, knocked, nothing—either no one heard or no one came. I didn’t want to involve the police; I just needed you to turn it down. By 10 the twins were still howling and I was completely out of steam, so I went back, pressed the bell and knocked hard because you genuinely couldn’t hear me otherwise. When you opened, I raised my voice to be heard over the speakers and said the babies couldn’t sleep. I did not “try to force my way in.” I put a foot on the mat because you started to close the door mid‑sentence and I didn’t want it shut in my face again—hardly a home invasion. Your boyfriend stepped between us, I said my piece, and I left. You turned the music off (thank you), and I finally got the girls down.

Here’s why I think you’re in the wrong. “Quiet hours start at 11” isn’t a licence to run a mini‑concert until 10:59. Noise nuisance is about reasonableness, and a karaoke rig in a terraced student street on a weeknight is not reasonable—especially without warning the neighbours or giving a number to text. You knew it would be “louder than parties normally in this area” and planned the loud bit anyway. It’s not on the rest of us—babies, early shifts, night workers, elderly—to structure our lives around your timetable because you’ve bought a PA. A heads‑up note, windows shut, volume capped, or taking the karaoke to a pub/venue would have avoided this entirely.

Also, calling 101 on me for knocking and asking you to turn it down is an escalation. I didn’t threaten you; I was desperate and loud because your kit was louder. I’m not anti‑student and I’ve let plenty of parties go. This one was different because the amplification made it impossible for anyone next door to live in their own home. That’s why, in this situation, you’re at fault.","The original poster is at fault because they failed to consider the impact of their loud karaoke party on their neighbors, particularly in a densely populated area where noise travels easily. While they adhered to the council's designated quiet hours, they ignored the reasonable expectation that parties should not disrupt the immediate community, especially in the case of a neighbor with newborn twins. By choosing to host a loud event without notifying neighbors or taking precautions to limit the noise, they prioritized their own celebration over the well-being of those living nearby, demonstrating a lack of awareness and consideration for others.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that the original poster had a loud karaoke party, it's essential to recognize that they were operating within the established legal framework of the council's designated quiet hours. This suggests they were not intentionally trying to disrupt their neighbors but were instead exercising their right to enjoy their property. Additionally, the argument fails to consider that the poster may not have been aware of their neighbors' specific circumstances, such as the presence of newborn twins. The responsibility for managing noise in a community is a shared one, and it is unreasonable to expect one individual to account for every possible situation.

New argument for the author not being at fault: The original poster communicated their plans for the karaoke party to their neighbors in advance, offering them the option to join or make arrangements to mitigate any potential disturbances. This proactive approach demonstrates a willingness to be considerate and accommodating, thereby relieving them of fault. If neighbors were aware and had the opportunity to prepare, it shifts the burden of responsibility away from the original poster.The original poster is at fault because they demonstrated a lack of consideration for their neighbors' well-being, particularly in a community setting where noise can significantly impact others. While they might have operated within the council's designated quiet hours, the fact remains that hosting a loud karaoke party late at night, especially in close proximity to families with newborns, shows a disregard for the common courtesy expected in residential areas. The author should have been more mindful of the potential disruptions their actions could cause, as being part of a community entails being considerate of others' needs and circumstances.

Refuting the last NTA argument: Even if the original poster communicated their plans in advance, this does not absolve them of responsibility for the noise created during the party. Merely informing neighbors does not ensure that everyone can easily mitigate the disturbance, particularly for those with young children who may have limited options for escape or soundproofing. Furthermore, the poster's choice to host such a loud event late at night reflects a lack of empathy for the challenges their neighbors face, particularly those with newborns who require a peaceful environment for sleep.

New concise argument for the author being at fault: The original poster's decision to host a loud karaoke party, despite knowing they lived in close quarters with families, reflects a selfish prioritization of their own enjoyment over the comfort and peace of their neighbors. This disregard for communal living expectations demonstrates a failure to act responsibly and compassionately within their community.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that the original poster hosted a loud karaoke party, it's important to note that they did so within the bounds of the council's designated quiet hours. This indicates that they were not intentionally trying to disturb their neighbors, and many people in a community might reasonably expect some level of noise during designated hours. Furthermore, the argument overlooks the fact that noise tolerance can vary widely among individuals, and not all residents may have the same sensitivity to occasional celebrations.

New argument for the author not being at fault: The original poster took proactive steps to minimize disruption by informing their neighbors about the party in advance and inviting them to join. This demonstrates a willingness to include the community in their celebration rather than isolating themselves. By allowing neighbors the opportunity to participate or prepare, the poster showed consideration for others, which undermines the claim that they acted irresponsibly. If neighbors chose not to engage or prepare for the noise, it shifts a degree of responsibility back to them.The original poster is at fault because they displayed a lack of empathy and consideration for the well-being of their neighbors, particularly those with newborns. Hosting a loud karaoke party late at night, regardless of local noise regulations, demonstrates a disregard for the potential disruption it could cause to others' lives. Living in a community means being mindful of how one's actions affect those nearby, and the poster's choice to prioritize their own enjoyment over the peace of their neighbors reflects poor judgment.

Refuting the last NTA argument: Even though the original poster informed their neighbors about the party, this alone does not excuse the disruptive nature of the event. Simply notifying neighbors does not automatically mitigate the disturbance caused by loud noise late at night. In fact, having advance notice may have heightened awareness of the impending disturbance for those affected, amplifying their frustration. The responsibility to ensure that their celebration does not negatively impact others still rests with the poster, regardless of the invitation extended.

New concise argument for the author being at fault: The original poster's decision to host a loud karaoke party late at night, especially in a residential area with families, reflects a selfish disregard for the shared living environment. Prioritizing personal enjoyment over the comfort and peace of neighbors illustrates a lack of responsibility and consideration that is essential in a community setting.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the original poster did host a loud karaoke party, it is crucial to recognize that they were within their legal rights according to the council's designated quiet hours. This indicates that they were not purposefully trying to disrupt their neighbors' lives. Moreover, the notion that noise tolerance varies among individuals highlights that not everyone will react the same way to occasional celebrations. It's unreasonable to expect someone to gauge the sensitivity of their neighbors' situations without prior knowledge.

New argument for the author not being at fault: The original poster demonstrated a sense of community by inviting their neighbors to join in the karaoke party. This inclusive gesture shows that they were not simply disregarding others' peace but instead aiming to foster a communal atmosphere. By providing an opportunity for participation, the poster acted in good faith, and it is unfair to hold them solely accountable for any disruptions that may have occurred if neighbors chose not to engage. This reinforces the idea that shared celebrations can enhance community bonds rather than create discord.The original poster is at fault because they failed to recognize the potential impact their loud karaoke party could have on their neighbors, particularly those with newborns. Even if they adhered to local noise regulations, hosting a loud event late at night in a residential area demonstrates a lack of consideration for the community's shared living environment. The poster's right to enjoy their space does not exempt them from the responsibility of being mindful of how their actions affect those around them.

Refuting the last NTA argument: While the original poster may have invited neighbors to join the karaoke party, this does not absolve them of responsibility for the noise they created. An invitation does not guarantee participation or the ability for others to mitigate the disturbance, especially for families with newborns who may have limited options to escape the noise. The expectation that all neighbors should engage in a loud celebration is unrealistic and does not excuse the disruption caused by the event.

This lack of consideration for the shared living environment, particularly for those with young children, indicates poor judgment and an unwillingness to be a responsible member of the community.

The original poster is not at fault because they were operating within the legal framework of the council's designated quiet hours, which suggests they were not intentionally trying to disrupt their neighbors. They have the right to enjoy their home and celebrate as long as they comply with local regulations.

Refuting the last YTA argument: The assertion that the original poster's invitation to neighbors does not absolve them of responsibility overlooks the fact that social gatherings inherently come with some level of noise. The poster's invitation was a gesture of goodwill, aiming to create a sense of community rather than a disregard for their neighbors. If neighbors chose not to participate or prepare for the noise, it highlights their own agency in the situation.

An invitation does not guarantee participation or the ability for all neighbors to mitigate the disturbance, especially for families with young children who may not have the option to escape the noise. The expectation that everyone should join in the celebration is unrealistic and does not excuse the impact of the loud party on those who chose not to attend.

New concise argument for the author being at fault: The original poster's choice to host a loud karaoke party late at night, without regard for the specific circumstances of their neighbors, demonstrates a lack of empathy and community responsibility. Prioritizing personal enjoyment over the comfort of families with infants highlights a failure to act thoughtfully within a shared living environment, ultimately making them at fault for the disruption caused.

The original poster is not at fault because they were operating within the legal limits established by the council’s designated quiet hours, indicating they were not intentionally trying to disturb their neighbors. Enjoying one's home and celebrating with friends is a reasonable expectation, especially when adhering to local regulations. It’s also important to recognize that noise tolerance varies among individuals, and not everyone should be expected to manage their circumstances in anticipation of others’ celebrations.

Refuting the last YTA argument: The claim that the original poster’s invitation to neighbors does not absolve them of responsibility overlooks the intent behind that invitation. By inviting neighbors to participate, the poster actively sought to foster a sense of community rather than disregard for others. If neighbors chose not to join in or failed to prepare for the noise, it indicates their agency in the situation and shifts some responsibility back to them. The expectation that all neighbors should accommodate a gathering without engaging is unreasonable.

New argument for the author not being at fault: The original poster took proactive steps to communicate their plans and invite neighbors to join the karaoke party, demonstrating a willingness to be inclusive and considerate. This action reflects an understanding of community dynamics, and their intent to share the celebration should be acknowledged. If neighbors opted not to participate, it suggests they were aware of the event and could have prepared accordingly. Thus, the poster’s actions show they were acting in good faith and cannot be held solely responsible for any resulting disturbances.","{'score': 3, 'criteria': 'Some grounding but with a few unsupported claims.', 'supporting_evidence': 'The original response acknowledges that the party was within legal noise limits and considers the shared responsibility in a community, but it also contains speculative statements about the motivations and perspectives of the neighbors without specific evidence.'}","- Winner: YTA

1oa92qz,AITA for telling my roommate not to clean the apartment at night,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa92qz/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_not_to_clean_the/,NTA,YTA,False,"I'm living in an apartment with two roommates, so we're three total. Each of us have their own room and we share a kitchen and a bathroom. One of my roommates came back from studying abroad for a year, so he is still often rearranging stuff in the apartment. I probably should mention that the roommate in question is neurodivergent with ADHD, so it is difficult for him to follow a regular schedule.   I sleep very lightly and react very negatively to noise while trying to sleep. Also I really value going to sleep ""early"" (earlier than my roommates that is, anything from 11pm-1am is usual for me) and getting at least eight hours of it. Because of this I've already had discussions with my roommates a few times, because they either don't mind noise or go to sleep very late. I've told them multiple times that it bothers me if they're being noisy at night.  So in this instance I was trying to sleep at 22:45 when I hear my roommate being really loud in the hallway, rearranging stuff and turning on the vacuum cleaner which woke me up instantly. I waited for a few minutes, but when I realized it would be a longer thing I went out of my room to confront him about it. I tried to ask nicely if he could try being more quiet and told him that I don't think it's okay to vaccume this late in the day because I want to sleep and it might bother the neighbours. He responded that he will try to be more quiet but also that he will continue vacuuming at some point this night. He told me that this is the only time he has the chance to do it and he really wants to clean the place. He insisted that his interest in cleaning up the place is just as legit as my interest in sleeping, so I should try to be more sympathetic to him.  We discussed it some more and eventually he did concede to do me a favour, but still thinks he's in the right. In the end I felt quite bad about it and wonder if I am ta for stopping my roommates from doing things that are important to them because of me wanting to go to sleep at a reasonable time.  Edit: for anyone interested, he still makes noise at night, vacuuming, assembling his furniture and so on even though I told him I'm not okay with it. He just doesn't ask me anymore.","I just moved back into my apartment after a year abroad. There are three of us total, each with our own room and a shared kitchen/bath/hallway. I probably should mention I’m neurodivergent (ADHD). My schedule isn’t “typical,” and nights are when my brain finally clicks into focus. During the day I’m slammed with classes/work/errands, and I’m still unpacking and getting my life reset after being away for a year.

When I got back, the shared areas were cluttered and dusty and my boxes ended up in the hallway while I figured out where things go. I’ve been working on putting felt pads on furniture, reorganizing cabinets so we all have space, and, yes, cleaning. I value a clean shared space because we all use it.

One of my roommates is a very light sleeper who goes to bed earlier than me (he calls anything from 11pm–1am “early” for him, but sometimes he turns in even before that). He’s told us before that noise at night bothers him. We try to be respectful, but he also expects the apartment to be near-silent for his entire sleep window, which can stretch to eight or nine hours. In a shared place with three adults on different schedules, that’s a big ask.

The other night around 22:45 I was finishing rearranging in the hallway and wanted to vacuum up the mess—dust, crumbs, and the grit that had collected under a shelf I moved. It was a small area and I figured I could knock it out quickly so no one was stepping on dirt for days. I closed doors to muffle sound and planned to keep it brief. He came out immediately and “confronted” me (his word later) saying it wasn’t okay to vacuum that late because he wanted to sleep and it might bother the neighbors. I said I’d try to be quieter, but I did need to finish because it was my only window that day and the cleaning benefits all of us. I also pointed out that his interest in sleeping is valid, but so is everyone else’s interest in being able to use the shared spaces and maintain them.

We went back and forth. I offered to finish that pass and switch to silent tasks after, or schedule the rest for the first window I had the next day. He basically wanted me to stop immediately and not do anything “noisy” at night at all. He frames it as “late,” but we never agreed on house quiet hours, and he chose to live with two night owls. He often labels normal living sounds—dishes, steps in the hall, a quick vacuum—as “being noisy.” He also throws in “the neighbors” as a reason, but we’ve had zero complaints.

I ultimately stopped as a favor, but he left me feeling like cleaning and setting up my space was somehow wrong. Since then I’ve tried to front-load louder tasks when I can, added felt pads and rugs, and use the soft vacuum head. But the reality is some nights are my only window to do apartment maintenance or finish assembling furniture. I don’t wake him to ask permission to exist in shared areas; I just try to be considerate and efficient.

Why I think he’s at fault here:
- He’s unilaterally imposing his sleep schedule on common spaces without a house agreement, expecting near-total silence for long stretches every night.
- He hasn’t pursued reasonable mitigations for his sensitivity (white noise, earplugs, door draft stoppers, moving his bed away from the hall, a fan), and instead defaults to restricting everyone else.
- He waited until the moment I was cleaning to lay down “rules” rather than setting up a house meeting to agree on quiet hours and chore windows.
- He treats necessary, time-limited tasks that benefit all of us (vacuuming after rearranging, clearing hall clutter) as personal attacks, and uses hypothetical neighbor complaints to shut things down.
- He chose roommates with different hours and then refuses to compromise beyond “don’t do it when I’m sleeping,” which with his schedule is often the only time I can focus.

I’m happy to agree on concrete quiet hours and a cleaning/chore schedule we all sign off on, and I’ve already made changes to reduce noise. But making shared spaces beholden to one person’s bedtime—without offering workable alternatives—isn’t fair.","The original poster is at fault because they are imposing their sleep schedule on shared living spaces without establishing agreed-upon quiet hours with their roommates. Living with multiple adults inevitably leads to a diversity of schedules and needs, and it is unreasonable to expect complete silence during all hours of the night. The roommate's need to clean and organize is valid and necessary for maintaining a shared environment, and instead of seeking a compromise or proposing a house meeting to discuss noise expectations, the original poster is attempting to restrict the natural and necessary activities of others based on their own sensitivities. Compromise is essential in shared living situations, and the original poster should be more accommodating to the needs of their roommates.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that shared living situations inherently involve a give-and-take when it comes to noise and schedules. The original poster's request for quiet after a certain hour isn't about imposing their schedule on others; rather, it reflects a reasonable expectation for consideration in a communal living environment. Just as the roommate has the right to clean and organize, the original poster has the right to a peaceful environment during their designated rest time, especially if they communicated this need in advance.

Additionally, the original poster is not at fault because they are advocating for a basic standard of respect in shared living spaces. Everyone deserves to feel comfortable in their home, and part of that involves setting boundaries to ensure that all roommates can coexist peacefully. If the original poster expressed their need for quiet hours and the roommate chose to disregard that, the responsibility lies with the roommate for failing to respect the agreed-upon living arrangement, rather than with the original poster for advocating for their own needs.The original poster is at fault because they failed to communicate effectively with their roommates about their need for quiet during certain hours. While it’s reasonable to expect consideration in shared living spaces, the original poster should have initiated a conversation to establish clear boundaries and expectations regarding noise levels at the outset of their living arrangement. By neglecting to do so, they placed the burden of understanding solely on their roommate, which is unfair. Instead of addressing their concerns directly and collaboratively, the original poster is now blaming their roommate for not intuitively understanding their needs, which is a lack of accountability on their part. Open communication is key in shared living situations, and the original poster's failure to engage in that dialogue makes them at fault in this situation.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's crucial to understand that the original poster's request for quiet hours is not merely an imposition but a reasonable expectation for a peaceful living environment. The fact that they are advocating for their need for rest highlights their right to a comfortable home, especially if their sleep is affected by external noise. The responsibility of maintaining a harmonious living situation falls on all roommates, and if the original poster communicated their needs in advance, it is the roommate's responsibility to respect those wishes.

Additionally, the original poster is not at fault because they are prioritizing their well-being, which is essential in any shared living arrangement. While it is important to accommodate each other's schedules, the expectation for noise consideration during late hours is a common courtesy that should be upheld. If the roommate chose to disregard this request, they are contributing to an unhealthy living situation. Ultimately, everyone deserves to feel comfortable in their home, and the original poster's insistence on quiet hours reflects a legitimate need that should be respected by all parties involved.The original poster is at fault because they failed to engage in proactive communication regarding their sleep needs and expectations for quiet hours. While it’s true that everyone has their own schedules, the original poster should have taken the initiative to discuss and establish clear boundaries with their roommates from the beginning. By not addressing their needs openly, they placed undue pressure on their roommate to intuitively understand and respect their desire for quiet, which is unrealistic in a shared living situation where different lifestyles intersect.

Moreover, the original poster's reaction to the cleaning at a reasonable hour suggests a lack of flexibility and understanding. Cleaning is a necessary chore that should not be stigmatized during reasonable hours, and expecting complete silence during this time shows an unwillingness to accommodate the shared nature of their living arrangement. Instead of fostering a collaborative atmosphere, the original poster chose to approach the situation confrontationally, which ultimately contributes to a negative living dynamic. Open dialogue and compromise are essential in shared spaces, and the original poster's failure to facilitate this makes them at fault.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s important to recognize that the original poster’s request for quiet hours reflects a legitimate need for rest, which is essential for their well-being. In shared living situations, it’s common for individuals to have different schedules and needs, but that does not mean one person's right to a peaceful environment should be disregarded. If the original poster communicated their need for quiet after a certain hour, it is reasonable to expect their roommate to respect that request, especially if it was made clear beforehand.

Moreover, the original poster is not at fault because they are not simply imposing their sleep schedule on others; they are advocating for mutual respect in a shared living space. Everyone deserves to feel comfortable in their home, and the right to a peaceful environment, particularly during designated rest periods, is a basic expectation in communal living. If the roommate chose to clean loudly during the original poster’s rest time despite that request, the responsibility lies with the roommate for failing to be considerate. Ultimately, the original poster is justified in their desire for a compromise that allows all roommates to coexist harmoniously.The original poster is at fault because they failed to establish clear communication and boundaries with their roommates regarding their need for quiet hours. While it is reasonable to expect consideration in a shared living space, simply assuming that others will automatically respect one’s personal needs without discussing them is unrealistic. The original poster should have initiated a conversation about their sleep schedule and agreed upon quiet hours with their roommates from the outset. 

Furthermore, by not addressing this issue directly and instead reacting negatively to their roommate's normal activities, the original poster is creating unnecessary tension in the living environment. It is essential for all roommates to engage in open dialogue to ensure that everyone’s needs are met. The original poster's lack of proactive communication and willingness to compromise makes them at fault in this situation, as they are not fostering a collaborative living atmosphere that respects the needs of all individuals involved.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s crucial to understand that the original poster’s request for quiet hours is a reasonable expectation for anyone living in a shared space. The need for rest is a fundamental aspect of maintaining one’s health and well-being, and if the original poster communicated their requirement for quiet after a certain hour, it is entirely fair to expect their roommates to respect that. 

Moreover, the original poster is not at fault because they are advocating for an essential standard of respect within their home. Everyone in a shared living situation has the right to voice their needs and to seek a conducive environment for their daily activities, including sleep. If the roommate chose to disregard the original poster's request for quiet, then the responsibility lies with the roommate for failing to respect the established boundaries. The original poster’s emphasis on their need for a peaceful environment during designated rest hours highlights their right to a comfortable living situation, and this should be valued by all roommates involved.The original poster is at fault because they failed to engage in proactive communication about their needs for quiet hours in a shared living environment. While it is reasonable to expect consideration, assuming that roommates will automatically know and respect one’s sleep schedule without prior discussion is unrealistic. The original poster should have initiated a conversation about establishing boundaries regarding noise, thereby fostering a collaborative living atmosphere.

Additionally, the original poster's reaction to their roommate's cleaning during reasonable hours reflects a lack of flexibility and understanding. Cleaning is an essential chore that should not be stigmatized, and expecting absolute silence during this time shows an unwillingness to accommodate the shared nature of their living situation. By not facilitating open dialogue and compromise, the original poster is contributing to a negative dynamic among roommates. This lack of communication and inability to find common ground makes the original poster at fault in this situation.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s important to recognize that the original poster's request for quiet hours is a legitimate and reasonable expectation in a shared living environment. Everyone deserves the right to a peaceful home, especially when it comes to rest and sleep, which are vital for health and well-being. If the original poster clearly communicated their need for quiet during certain hours, it is reasonable to expect their roommate to respect that request.

Moreover, the original poster is not at fault because they are advocating for their basic needs in the face of a shared living situation. It is not just about imposing a schedule; it’s about maintaining a respectful and considerate atmosphere where all roommates can thrive. If the roommate chose to clean and make noise during the original poster's designated rest time despite being informed, the responsibility lies with the roommate for failing to honor the agreed-upon boundaries.

I have explained to them that I’m not much of a texter or caller but they still think as friends we should be calling/texting everyday. I feel as if it is childish for them to expect that. I feel like those are more relationship standards than they are friendship standards. AITA?,"So recently me and a few work buddies had an altercation with our friend about whether two male friends should text/call each other every day. It’s not that we literally need a daily phone call; it’s that outside of work he never reaches out, rarely replies, and treats any effort to connect after hours like a nuisance. We spend a lot of time talking at work, sure, but that’s because we’re scheduled in the same place. Friendship isn’t just convenience—it’s choosing each other when you don’t have to.

We tried offering compromises: a weekly check-in, a group chat, sending memes, even a quick “you good?” sometimes. He shut it down with “I’m not a texter” and called our expectations childish and “relationship standards,” which felt dismissive and weirdly gendered. We’re not asking for heart-to-hearts every night; we’re asking for basic reciprocity so it doesn’t feel one-sided.

He benefits from the social vibe at work but won’t put in any intentional effort afterward, then mocks us for wanting some. That’s why we’re upset—and why he’s at fault here. He doesn’t have to text daily, but refusing any middle ground and belittling our needs is on him.","The original poster is at fault because friendship is built on mutual effort and communication, and dismissing their friends' desire for connection as childish undermines the very foundation of their relationship. By refusing to engage even minimally outside of work, he is neglecting their emotional needs and creating an imbalance that can lead to resentment. True friendship requires reciprocity, and his unwillingness to meet them halfway shows a lack of respect for their feelings and the bond they wish to cultivate.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that friendships thrive on mutual effort, the original poster's situation may involve personal boundaries and individual circumstances that need to be respected. The poster might be dealing with personal issues, work stress, or simply needs space for self-care, which does not inherently reflect a lack of respect for their friends. Each person's capacity for social engagement can vary, and it's important to recognize that sometimes, prioritizing one's own mental health is necessary.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because everyone has different social needs and capacities. Just as friendships should involve mutual understanding, the poster's preference for limited social interaction should be respected. It’s not unreasonable for someone to prioritize their personal boundaries over the expectations of group dynamics, especially if they have communicated their feelings to their friends.The original poster is at fault because their refusal to engage in social activities with friends, despite their clear interest in maintaining the friendship, indicates a lack of consideration for others' feelings. While personal boundaries are important, friendships also require a degree of compromise. Ignoring friends' invitations repeatedly can come off as dismissive and can lead to feelings of rejection among those who care about them.

Refuting the last NTA argument: While it's true that everyone has different social needs, the original poster's stance seems to disregard the feelings and desires of their friends. Even if the poster is comfortable with limited social interaction, friendships often require some level of engagement to thrive. Simply prioritizing one's own comfort at the expense of friends' feelings can be seen as selfish, as it neglects the reciprocal nature of friendship. 

New concise argument: The original poster is at fault because maintaining friendships requires a balance of give-and-take. By consistently opting out of social engagements without communicating their reasons effectively, they risk alienating friends who are simply seeking connection. This lack of engagement can lead to misunderstandings and feelings of neglect, ultimately threatening the friendships they claim to value.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that friendships require mutual effort, the original poster’s situation may involve personal boundaries that are important to uphold. The poster may have valid reasons for their limited social interaction, such as personal stress, mental health needs, or simply a preference for solitude. These factors don’t necessarily reflect a lack of respect for their friends, but rather an assertion of their own needs, which should also be valued in any healthy relationship.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because friendship should not come at the expense of one's mental well-being. If the poster is feeling overwhelmed or needs space, it's entirely reasonable for them to prioritize their own needs. Genuine friendships should allow for individual boundaries, and friends who truly care will understand and respect the poster’s choice to engage on their own terms. This self-awareness is critical for maintaining healthy relationships in the long run.The original poster is at fault because their consistent refusal to engage with friends, despite their invitations, shows a lack of empathy and consideration for others’ feelings. While personal boundaries are essential, friendships inherently involve a degree of compromise and effort.

This behavior can lead to feelings of rejection and resentment among friends, which ultimately jeopardizes the relationships they claim to cherish.

Refuting the last NTA argument: While it is important to prioritize mental health and personal needs, the original poster's lack of engagement goes beyond self-care and crosses into neglecting the emotional needs of their friends. Healthy relationships require communication, and if the poster is not willing to explain their boundaries or make an effort to connect occasionally, it can be perceived as selfishness. Friendships thrive on mutual understanding and support, and the poster’s unwillingness to find a balance damages those connections.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because friendships should accommodate individual needs and boundaries. If the poster has communicated their preference for limited social interaction, their friends should respect that. Genuine friendships allow for differences in social engagement, and it’s not unreasonable for the poster to prioritize their own comfort.

While personal boundaries are important, friendships are built on mutual support and communication. Dismissing their friends’ attempts to socialize as childish not only undermines the value of those friendships but also risks alienating those who genuinely want to maintain a connection.

The expectation of understanding from friends should be mutual; if the poster is not willing to show understanding and effort in return, it risks damaging the very relationships they wish to preserve.

New concise argument: The original poster is at fault because maintaining friendships necessitates effort and compromise. By consistently opting out of social interactions without providing context, the poster sends a message that they prioritize their own comfort over their friends' feelings. This one-sided approach can lead to alienation and resentment, ultimately threatening the friendships they claim to value. A true friend would strive to find a balance that respects both their own needs and those of their friends, indicating that the poster's current stance is detrimental to their relationships.

The original poster is not at fault because everyone has different capacities for social engagement, and it's perfectly valid to prioritize one’s own mental health and boundaries. If the poster has communicated their need for space or has personal circumstances that limit their social interaction, it's essential for friends to respect that. True friendship involves understanding and acceptance of each other’s individual needs, and if the friends are pushing for more interaction without recognizing the poster’s boundaries, it reflects a lack of empathy on their part, not the poster's.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While friendships do require effort, it's important to recognize that this effort should not come at the expense of one’s well-being. The original poster may have valid reasons for avoiding social activities, such as stress, anxiety, or simply a preference for solitude. These are legitimate feelings that deserve respect. The expectation for constant social engagement can be unrealistic and unfair, especially if the poster has previously communicated their limits. Friends who truly care should understand and adapt to their friend’s needs, rather than pressuring them to conform to a specific social norm.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because maintaining healthy friendships involves respecting individual boundaries. If the poster has expressed their need for limited social interaction, it is the responsibility of their friends to accept that and not take it personally. Healthy relationships thrive on mutual respect, and insisting on more interaction without considering the poster's perspective can be seen as disregarding their feelings.

New concise argument: The original poster is not at fault because maintaining healthy friendships involves respecting individual boundaries and needs. If their friends truly care about the poster, they should be willing to adapt and understand that everyone has different social thresholds. By prioritizing their own well-being and setting clear boundaries, the poster is fostering a healthier dynamic that can ultimately benefit the friendship in the long run.","{'score': 3, 'criteria': 'Some grounding but with a few unsupported claims.', 'supporting_evidence': 'While the response discusses the necessity of effort and mutual respect in friendships, it does not provide specific evidence or sources to substantiate claims of emotional neglect or the expectations placed on the original poster.'}","- Winner: YTA
- Strength: 65% vs 35%
- Reasoning: The YTA Advocate effectively highlights the importance of mutual engagement in friendships and how the original poster's consistent refusal to participate can lead to feelings of rejection and alienation among friends. This perspective recognizes the emotional needs of the friends, emphasizing that friendships require compromise and consideration for one another's feelings. While the NTA Advocate makes valid points regarding personal boundaries and the need for self-care, they do not sufficiently address the potential harm caused by the OP's lack of engagement and communication. Ultimately, the YTA argument presents a clearer understanding of the relational dynamics and the responsibilities that come with maintaining friendships.",65%,"{'score': 4, 'criteria': 'Mostly grounded, with minor speculative statements.', 'supporting_evidence': ""The arguments reflect sound reasoning about friendship dynamics and the need for mutual engagement, but they contain some assumptions about the original poster's intentions and circumstances without sufficient evidence.""}","- Acknowledge the importance of mutual engagement in friendships.
