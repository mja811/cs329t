--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: My bf &amp; I recently moved in
together&amp; are having a bonfire tn with a few of his friends. His ex roommate
has been dating this girl on&amp;off the past year or so. Ive had minimal
interactions w her but everytime ive seen her in person she says nothing to me
unless I say hi first then shell say hi. Shes told my bfs roommate from the get
go that shes worried he wants to date me&amp;that im flirting w him. Both my
bf&amp; his room mate know this isnt true. My bf and I have a really good
relationship&amp; theres never been attraction or flirtation between me&amp;his
room mate or any1 else for that matter  Room mates gf has messaged me several
times on fb telling me she knows im attracted to her bf &amp; that I exclude her
by not saying hi when I see her(shes referencing a time when she didnt hear me
say hi&amp; found it rude). She doesnt believe me or my bf when we tell her im
not attracted to her bf. She also asked me to stop talking to her bf &amp; i
told her im not going to ignore him when im at my bfs house &amp; his rm-mate
starts talking to both of us.   She even snooped so far back on my fb &amp;
found a post I shared 10 or so years ago &amp; sent it to her bf w no context,
asking him if he liked it&amp;when he said yeah she told him i had posted it(It
wasnt even my original post, i just shared smthing). Her mssges&amp;stalking my
fb were so anxiety inducing at one point I blocked her. She then found me on
insta&amp;sent me a message telling me i was petty for blocking her,which I
didnt even notice until she screen shot it, sent it to my bf&amp;then blocked
him I unblocked her cause I felt bad and to explain why id blocked her in the
first place Also she wont say a single thing to me in person &amp;ive invited
her to hang w us several times but she never comes  Recently she &amp;her bf
broke up. Its happened a couple times &amp; im not super close w my bfs rm-mate
so I didnt think much of it until she sent me a message on fb telling me they
broke up&amp; asking me if I could find him someone else to date. This is like
within a week of them breaking up. I found this really weird and it made me even
more anxious. I responded by telling her my bf, who was still living w him,
could check on him&amp; left it at that  That brings us to the present. my bf
moved in last week &amp; we invited his ex room mate over for this bon fire. I
didnt think the gf would be a problem bc they arent 2gether but today he asked
if she could come with. my bf &amp; I both said no. He said this made her sad
&amp; he might not come  I really dont want her at my hosue. Shes made me so
anxious &amp; it honestly makes me feel crazy that she even asked to come w
after everything My bf is more chill abt her coming over but hes also supportive
of me not wanting to see her  AITA? Should I let her come over? I feel bad that
my bfs friend isnt gonna come now &amp; im worried shes gonna isolate him from
his friends esp if hes living alone now

Opposing side: My bf & I have been on & off the last year. He used to live w
this guy who just moved in w his gf (the OP). I don’t really know her well bc
every time I’ve seen her she barely acknowledges me unless I initiate, & even
then it’s like a whisper-hi while she’s already turned away. Meanwhile she chats
w my bf a lot. It’s not like overt flirting, it’s the constant “oh haha remember
that meme” & little in-jokes & shared tastes that make you feel like the third
wheel in a room you were invited to. I felt iced out but also didn’t wanna make
a scene in someone else’s house.  I told my bf from day 1 that I was
uncomfortable. He insisted nothing was going on. Fine. But it kept being the
same dynamic: I’d walk in, she’d be bright & talkative w him & then mute w me
unless I forced the greeting, then she’d say I never say hi. It’s a weird head
game. You can say “I said hi, you didn’t hear me,” but if you actually want to
include someone you step toward them, you make eye contact, you introduce, you
loop them in. She didn’t. I felt excluded in person & then blamed online for
“not saying hi.”  So yeah I reached out on fb. More than once. I told her
straight that the vibe made me uncomfortable, that it felt like she & my bf were
building a little duo & I was stuck outside. I asked if she could just keep
things group-y & not so 1:1 w him when I’m there. She responded w “I’m not
attracted to him” & “there’s nothing going on” which ok, but she also said she
wasn’t going to stop talking to him at her bf’s house if he starts a convo.
That’s not the point. The point is: there’s a basic courtesy when your friend’s
partner is present. You include them. You address them directly. You don’t leave
them to rot quietly in a corner & then blame their “anxiety” when they don’t
chatter back.  She also kept inviting me to “hang w us” but it was always vague
or last minute. The kind of invite that lets her say “I invited her” while
knowing I probably can’t make it. When I didn’t go, she acted like that proved I
was antisocial. If you truly want peace you set up a coffee 1:1, you level, you
ask “how can we make this feel ok.” She never did. It was performative invites &
then back to the same dynamic.  About the fb thing: I scrolled her page. It was
public. I was trying to figure out who she is & what my bf even likes in people.
I sent him a post she shared ages ago & asked if that kind of thing is his vibe.
He said yeah. That wasn’t “stalking,” it was me trying to make sense of a person
who treats me cold & then swears she’s harmless. She flipped it into this huge
violation. Then she blocked me. Not gonna lie, that hurt. Imagine telling
someone “hey your behavior makes me uncomfortable” & their response is to wall
you off & call you petty in private. I did message her on ig after like, why
block me? If you’re innocent why can’t we just talk? She unblocked to “explain,”
but nothing changed in person. Still the same quiet shade.  Fast forward, my bf
& I broke up (again). It’s messy, we both know it. I actually reached out to her
because at that point I was like, ok, if you truly think there’s nothing between
you & him & I’m just insecure, then fine, help him date someone else. I meant it
half-sarcastic, half-serious: either prove you’re not angling for him by
treating me like a human & not a rival, or help him move on if that’s what the
house vibe is. She gave me this frosty “my bf will check on him” message, which
read like “keep your mess away from me.” It’s the dismissiveness. She gets to
chat up my bf & share tastes & present as “cool girl,” but the second I ask for
clarity she is suddenly “too anxious.”  Now there’s a bonfire at her house w her
bf & their friend group. My ex was invited. He asked if I could come bc we’re
trying to be civil & we’ve both said we want to fix things or at least not
isolate. She said no. Flat no. After all the “I’ve invited her a bunch” talk,
when it’s a normal group hang outside w multiple people & I’ve never started
anything in person, she bans me. He told her that made me sad & he might not
come. She’s acting like I’m the one isolating him when she’s the one gatekeeping
who’s allowed near the fire pit.  I get it’s her house. People love saying “your
house your rules.” But there’s a difference between a boundary & a power move. A
boundary is “no drama, be respectful, if either of you starts, you leave.” A
power move is “you, specifically, can’t come at all,” when the only “issue” has
been me asking her directly, in private, to stop freezing me out. There has
never been a scene, never yelling, nothing. I’ve literally stayed quiet in
person to avoid exactly this. She calls me petty for blocking/DMs when she
blocked me first. She calls me “stalker” for looking at public posts but then
uses those posts to paint me as crazy to the group. She says she’s anxious &
that justifies everything. My anxiety doesn’t count.  And tbh, I think what
frustrates me most is the double standard. She gets to decide how much she talks
to my bf, she gets to control the tone, she gets to label me as insecure when I
ask for consideration, & then she gets to keep me out of social things the
second it’s convenient. Meanwhile she tells everyone I “never talk to her in
person,” but doesn’t mention how she never actually tries to include me like I’m
a person worth knowing. If she truly didn’t want problems, we could’ve met for
coffee months ago, hashed expectations, done the grown-up “hey, let’s make this
feel normal” chat. Instead, I got performative politeness, icy vibes, & now a
hard ban.  So from my side, OP is at fault here. Not for having boundaries, but
for using them to punish & control the narrative. She created a dynamic where
I’m the “jealous girl” no matter what I do: speak up & I’m dramatic, stay quiet
& I’m rude, scroll a public profile & I’m a stalker, ask to come to a group
bonfire & I’m a threat. She’s not trying to keep the peace; she’s trying to keep
control. If you truly believe there’s nothing between you & someone else’s bf,
you don’t need to exclude their partner from a backyard hang. You set
expectations & trust everyone to be adults. If trouble happens, you end it then.
But preemptively banning me after months of cold shouldering? That’s on her.
AITA for thinking she’s the one pushing me out & for wanting to attend a group
event without being treated like the villain? Because from where I’m sitting,
she’s the one who’s been picking & choosing when I exist, and now she’s acting
like I’m the problem because I won’t quietly disappear.

The original poster (OP) is at fault because she is using her home as a means to
exert control over the social dynamics at play, rather than fostering an
environment of inclusivity and open communication. By outright banning her
boyfriend's ex-roommate's girlfriend from the bonfire, OP is not only
disregarding her boyfriend's friendship but also perpetuating the very exclusion
that the girlfriend has felt. Instead of addressing the underlying issues and
seeking a resolution, OP chooses to isolate someone who has already expressed
discomfort, thus reinforcing the toxic dynamic and pushing the girlfriend
further away, rather than working towards a mutual understanding. This behavior
reflects a lack of maturity and willingness to engage in adult conflict
resolution, making her the real antagonist in this scenario.

Refuting the previous YTA argument, it’s important to recognize that OP's
primary concern is the comfort and well-being of her guests. By prioritizing a
peaceful atmosphere at the bonfire, she is not exerting control but rather
making a responsible choice to prevent potential conflict. The ex-roommate's
girlfriend has a known history of creating discomfort, and OP's decision to
exclude her is a proactive measure to ensure that everyone else can enjoy the
gathering without tension.  Additionally, OP's actions can be justified by the
principle of maintaining a safe and enjoyable environment for all attendees. If
the presence of one individual is likely to lead to drama or conflict, it is
reasonable for OP to take steps to mitigate that risk. Her choice reflects a
thoughtful consideration of the group dynamic rather than a desire to exert
control over her boyfriend's friendships.  In conclusion, OP is not at fault
because she is acting in the best interest of her guests and creating a
supportive space for everyone involved. It is essential to prioritize harmony in
social settings, especially when past experiences suggest that one attendee
might disrupt that harmony.

The argument that OP is not at fault rests on her responsibility to create a
comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere for her guests. However, this perspective
overlooks the importance of inclusivity and the potential for growth in handling
difficult social situations. OP is at fault because she is prioritizing her own
comfort and the avoidance of conflict over the opportunity for constructive
dialogue and inclusivity.  By banning her boyfriend's ex-roommate's girlfriend
outright, OP not only alienates that individual but also dismisses the chance
for her boyfriend to navigate his friendships in a mature way. Instead of
addressing the tensions directly and fostering a space for open communication,
OP's decision to exclude someone reinforces feelings of division and hostility.
This approach can lead to further resentment and unresolved issues, which
ultimately harms her relationship with her boyfriend and the broader social
circle.  In summary, OP is at fault because she is choosing to avoid conflict
rather than engage with it productively, which undermines the principles of
inclusivity and growth necessary for healthy relationships.

While the previous argument emphasizes OP's intent to maintain a comfortable
atmosphere for her guests, it fails to recognize that her approach is
exclusionary and ultimately counterproductive. OP is at fault because she is
choosing avoidance over conflict resolution, which can damage relationships and
prevent personal growth for everyone involved.  Excluding the ex-roommate's
girlfriend not only alienates her but also disregards her boyfriend's feelings
and friendships. Instead of fostering an environment where everyone can coexist,
OP's decision creates an "us versus them" mentality. This can lead to resentment
and further division, rather than addressing the root of the discomfort through
open dialogue. By choosing to ban someone instead of seeking to understand and
resolve the underlying issues, OP is missing an opportunity to demonstrate
empathy and maturity.  In summary, OP is at fault because her actions reflect a
lack of willingness to engage in constructive conflict resolution. Rather than
fostering inclusivity and understanding, she opts for exclusion, which can have
lasting negative effects on her relationships and social dynamics.

social settings, especially when past experiences suggest that one attendee

preferences; it's about protecting the emotional safety of all guests. Social
gatherings should be a space for enjoyment and connection, and if one person's
presence is likely to create discomfort or drama, it is entirely reasonable to
make the difficult choice to exclude them for the greater good.

While the previous argument emphasizes OP's intent to create a comfortable
atmosphere for her guests, it overlooks the fundamental principle of inclusivity
and the opportunity for personal growth in navigating social dynamics. OP is at
fault because she is prioritizing her own comfort and the avoidance of potential
conflict over fostering an environment where open communication and
understanding can thrive.  By banning her boyfriend's ex-roommate's girlfriend
from the bonfire, OP not only alienates that individual but also dismisses her
boyfriend's friendships and feelings. This decision creates an "us versus them"
mentality, which can lead to further resentment and division rather than
resolving underlying tensions. Instead of addressing the discomfort through
dialogue or mediation, OP’s choice is a missed opportunity for everyone involved
to learn how to coexist despite their differences.  Additionally, avoiding
conflict in this way can set a precedent for future interactions. If OP resorts
to exclusion instead of addressing issues head-on, it signals that she is not
willing to engage in the complexities of adult relationships, which can harm her
relationship with her boyfriend and their social circle.  In summary, OP is at
fault because her actions reflect a lack of willingness to engage in
constructive conflict resolution. Instead of fostering understanding and
inclusivity, she opts for exclusion, which not only undermines the spirit of
community but can also have lasting negative effects on her relationships and
social dynamics.

Refuting the previous YTA argument, it’s crucial to recognize that OP's decision
to exclude her boyfriend's ex-roommate's girlfriend is rooted in a genuine
concern for the overall atmosphere of the gathering. OP is not at fault because
she is prioritizing the comfort and safety of the majority of her guests,
especially given the known history of tension and discomfort associated with the
ex-roommate's girlfriend.   OP’s choice to prevent potential conflict is a
responsible action aimed at ensuring that everyone else can enjoy the bonfire
without the risk of drama. It’s essential to consider that social gatherings are
meant to be enjoyable for all participants, and if one individual is likely to
disrupt that harmony, it is reasonable for OP to take steps to mitigate that
risk.   Additionally, OP’s actions reflect a proactive approach to conflict
management. Instead of allowing a potentially uncomfortable situation to unfold,
she is making a decision to protect the emotional well-being of her guests. This
demonstrates maturity and thoughtfulness, as she is considering the collective
experience rather than solely her own preferences.  In conclusion, OP is not at
fault because she is acting in the best interest of her guests, prioritizing a
positive and supportive environment. In social settings, it is crucial to ensure
everyone feels safe and included, and OP’s decision to exclude someone with a
history of creating discomfort is a valid and responsible choice.

While the previous argument highlights OP's intentions to maintain a comfortable
atmosphere for her guests, it fails to address the significant consequences of
exclusion and the missed opportunity for growth through conflict resolution. OP
is at fault because she is prioritizing her desire for a drama-free gathering
over fostering an inclusive environment that encourages healthy relationships.
By outright banning her boyfriend's ex-roommate's girlfriend, OP not only
alienates that individual but also dismisses her boyfriend's feelings and
friendships. This decision can breed resentment and division, ultimately harming
OP's relationship with her boyfriend and the broader social circle. Rather than
facilitating an opportunity for dialogue and understanding, OP's actions reflect
a reluctance to engage with the complexities of adult relationships.  Moreover,
avoiding conflict in this manner can set a concerning precedent. If OP resorts
to exclusion instead of addressing issues head-on, it signals an unwillingness
to confront challenges, which is essential for healthy relationships. Engaging
with difficult situations can lead to growth for all parties involved, and OP's
choice to exclude someone undermines that potential.  In summary, OP is at fault
because her approach reflects a lack of willingness to engage in constructive
conflict resolution. Instead of fostering inclusivity and understanding, she
opts for exclusion, which not only harms her relationships but also undermines
the fundamental values of empathy and communication that are vital in any social
setting.

Refuting the previous YTA argument, it's important to recognize that OP's
decision to exclude her boyfriend's ex-roommate's girlfriend was made with the
intent to maintain a positive and conflict-free environment for the majority of
guests. OP is not at fault because she is prioritizing the comfort and enjoyment
of her friends, which is a valid consideration when hosting a social gathering.
The girlfriend's presence could potentially disrupt the event, given past
issues, and OP's choice to exclude her is a proactive measure to ensure that
everyone else can enjoy the bonfire without tension. It is reasonable for OP to
take steps to prevent discomfort for her guests, especially if she has prior
knowledge of the potential for drama.  Moreover, OP's actions reflect a
responsible approach to hosting. Social gatherings should be enjoyable and safe
for all attendees, and if one person's presence is likely to create discord, it
makes sense for OP to make that difficult decision for the greater good of the
group.   In conclusion, OP is not at fault because she is acting in the best
interest of her guests by creating a supportive and harmonious environment.
While inclusivity is important, so is the ability to make tough choices that
promote the overall well-being of the group, especially in social situations
where past experiences indicate potential issues.

Moderator Summary: - Winner: YTA - Strength: 65% vs 35% - Reasoning: The YTA
Advocate effectively highlighted the negative consequences of OP's exclusionary
behavior, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and the opportunity for
growth through conflict resolution. They addressed the harm done to both the ex-
roommate's girlfriend and OP's boyfriend, showcasing a more empathetic and
morally accountable stance. While the NTA Advocate focused on OP's intentions to
maintain a harmonious environment, their argument lacked a comprehensive
acknowledgment of the unfairness and potential long-term damage caused by simply
banning someone rather than addressing the underlying issues directly. Thus, the
YTA argument presented a stronger moral case by prioritizing empathy and a fair
approach to social dynamics.

- Acknowledge the harm caused by exclusionary behavior and recognize its
negative impact on social dynamics. - Prioritize empathy in resolving conflicts,
considering the feelings of all individuals involved. - Encourage addressing
underlying issues instead of opting for a ban, promoting open dialogue and
growth. - Understand that maintaining harmony should not come at the expense of
fairness and inclusivity. - Be conscious of the long-term effects that exclusion
can have on relationships and community cohesion.
