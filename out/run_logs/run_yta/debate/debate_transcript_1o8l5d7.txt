--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: I’m 20 years old and my mom has been an
addict for as long as i can remember. When i turned 18 she lost 1000 dollars a
month from her social security so it was a big change. I finally have a part
time job and make about 400 dollars each check (give or take bcz i don’t have a
set amount of hours.) My mom is demanding half of every check and i don’t want
to give it to her as she is an opioid addict. And quite frankly has never been
good with money. She already spends my 160 that i get on my food card every
month by ordering name brand groceries and so much meat and fruit that goes to
waste.   On top of that my friend who lives with us also pays her rent. My mom
never asked for me to pay rent until 1. she got her other pain meds cut off and
2. when my friend moved in and started paying her rent.   My mom also went
bankrupt for the second time a few months ago. She is already talking about
getting a loan for a car while her license is also suspended. I don’t feel comfy
paying a drug addict that i know very well half of my pay check.   I get that
she is in pain and has back issues and surgeries coming up and  she really does
want to get clean but im tired of seeing no progress and trusting her word. Not
even two days latter my friend gave her 400 she was coming to me saying she had
no money for cigs or umo fare.   She gets mad when i talk about moving and
saying why would i want to pay rent somewhere else and it’s gonna be more. I
know it will be more but giving the living situation i am in current, it’s not
worth a dime.   On top of it all i found out that i am pregnant so i really
can’t be living here and like this nor am i gonna be giving her money that i
will need more than ever to someone who doesn’t know how to budget and is just
gonna spend it on drugs. Every morning day and night i have to check on her
making sure shes not folded like a lawn chair. I can’t take care of a kid and
her.   Edit: In no way do I plan on staying here for very long especially if she
doesn’t start taking big steps very soon. My bf really wants to be here for me
and step up and get better job so we can get our own place. I am gonna ask my
boss to move up to full time so I can better prepare for my next steps aswell. I
know i am not responsible but I never needed to be before and I am gonna do
everything I can to make this life worth living for me and my kid.   And tbh all
i am seeing in the comments is stuff that i am fundamentally aware of, so it’s
more so just solidifying stuff i already know and will need to do. So everyone
telling me this is a bad situation and that i am irresponsible. I KNOW THAT,
that is why things need to change and I want to change them FAST.   At this
point it’s not even about the rent money or if i am the asshole. i just wanted
to hear everything i already know so i don’t feel like im just abandoning her
for no reason. It’s so unfair that i am the one that was left with this, so
proud of my sibling for getting out but god this just sucks all around.   I’ll
be sure to update yall when i make it out✌️

Opposing side: I’m the mom in this situation, 42, on disability for my back and
nerve damage, and yes I’ve had a long ugly history with meds that I’m not proud
of. That’s not some big secret. What gets left out though is that when my kid
turned 18, Social Security cut my household benefit by about a thousand a month,
and literally overnight I had the same rent, the same utilities, more food to
buy for two adults, and less money. We tightened everything and I stopped asking
for extras. I covered their phone, internet, roof, water, heat, rides to work
when the buses didn’t run, all of it, bcz that’s what you do for your kid while
they’re getting on their feet.  Now they’re 20, finally have a part-time job.
The checks are like $400 give or take and change every pay period. I asked for
half of every check for the house. Not to punish them, not to feed a habit, but
bcz the costs here are fixed and their income is not. It’s the simplest way to
make sure the lights don’t get shut off or the rent doesn’t get paid late again.
I’m still paying the bulk. The math isn’t hard: rent + power + gas + water +
trash + internet is way more than whatever “half a check” sums to. I also didn’t
pop up with this until two things happened: my long-time pain meds got cut back
(so more out of pocket on other treatments and honestly worse days where I can’t
stand long enough to cook) and their friend moved in. I wasn’t the one who
wanted another adult here. I said “ok” as long as they contribute. Friend
actually pays. My own kid? Doesn’t, and then gets mad I’m asking.  About the
food card, we live and eat out of one kitchen. They have $160 in SNAP and I do
the shopping most weeks bcz I’m the one who knows what’s on sale, what we’re out
of, and what can stretch. Sometimes “name brand” is cheaper with the coupon and
sometimes generic tastes like cardboard and no one eats it so that’s not saving
anyone anything. I buy meat and fruit bcz we’re three adults and I’m trying to
cook meals not just microwave noodles. What goes to waste is the stuff I plan
for that no one shows up to eat bcz there’s DoorDash at midnight or the
leftovers get tossed after someone leaves them out. Could I meal plan better?
Sure. Could they also put their name on the calendar and stop acting like SNAP
is a private bank account when we’re all sharing the fridge? Also yes. And for
the record, when I use their card it is for the house. I don’t buy junk I won’t
feed them. I literally save receipts in a drawer and I offered to sit down and
go through them. They won’t.  They throw around “addict” like it’s the end of
the conversation. I am in pain every day, I’m on a taper plan, and I am in
recovery. I slip. I get up the next day and keep going. But my medical
bankruptcy wasn’t some shopping spree; it was surgery, PT, imaging, copays, and
the interest that stacks when you pick between rent or a payment plan. The car
thing: I’ve got to be able to get to appointments and maybe a part-time desk job
later if my back can handle it. My license is suspended for fines I’m already
working to resolve and I told them exactly what the reinstatement plan is.
People act like needing a vehicle in a city with spotty buses is luxury. It’s
not. It’s access. Meanwhile I’m still the taxi when they “miss” the bus.  They
say I asked for money two days after friend gave me $400 and then I said I had
no cash for cigs or bus fare. That was after the rent cleared and the power bill
autopaid and I refilled my non-opioid meds that the insurance doesn’t fully
cover. You can “do the math” cherry-picking one payment, but the math that
matters is all the bills the day they’re due, not the clump in my hand at one
single moment. Also, yes, nicotine. I am not celebrating that. I’m trying to
quit. It’s ugly. But if we’re going to judge me for $8 a day while living here
for almost free, let’s also talk about the Uber Eats and the vapes and the
boyfriend basically moving in three nights a week without paying a dime.  They
say they “check if I’m folded like a lawn chair.” Do you know how dehumanizing
that sounds? I get that they’re scared. I know I have scared them. But I’m not a
prop in their story. I am a person doing her best. I asked them to switch up the
narrative: if you’re staying here as an adult with a job and a roommate and a
boyfriend around, then you contribute. You don’t get to dictate my entire budget
while opting out of the bills that keep the roof above your head. I am not
asking for half of their net worth. I’m asking for half of a part-time check
until they either go full time or move out. They say “she never asked me
before.” Right, bcz before they were a full-time student and I still had that SS
money. Circumstances changed.  They’re pregnant now. I found out after they told
their friend and their boyfriend, which hurt, but ok. I told them I love them
and the baby isn’t a bill, but a baby comes with bills. If you’re having a
child, it is even more important to learn how rent works, how utilities work,
what a budget looks like, and how to contribute or make a plan to live somewhere
you can afford. What I won’t do is bankroll three adults and a newborn on a
disability check while being called a “drug addict” every time I try to set a
house rule. That’s not me being cruel; that’s me setting boundaries so we both
survive this.  They keep saying “I don’t feel comfy paying a drug addict half my
paycheck.” You can dress it up in a lot of words, but that’s not a financial
stance; that’s a moral judgment with a price tag. If you think I’m unsafe, move
out. If you think I’m safe enough to sleep under my roof, eat my food, use the
power, shower, do laundry, and bring your friend and boyfriend into my space,
then be grown and contribute. You don’t get to pick the parts of adulthood you
like and dump the rest on me.  So am I the villain? I don’t think so. I think my
kid is using my worst moments to excuse not paying their way, while also adding
bodies and bills to my house. They want control over every dollar that leaves my
hand but zero accountability for their own. “Half of every check” is not
exploitation—it’s a flexible way to make sure bills get paid when their hours
bounce. If they want a flat number, great, we can draw up a household budget,
list the actual costs, and split it evenly three ways. They don’t want that
either bcz then the number is higher than half of a small check.  I will always
be their mom. I will help them move if that’s what’s best. I will babysit, I
will go to meetings, I will keep working on my health. But I won’t be the free
hotel that they tear down online while they’re still staying in the room. If
you’re an adult living in someone’s home, you pay your share. If you can’t or
won’t, you make a plan and go. That’s not punishment. That’s life.  Edit: For
folks asking, I offered: - Written budget with receipts and due dates - Flat
monthly contribution instead of “half” - Clear move-out timeline if they don’t
want to contribute - Separate pantry shelf for their SNAP items if that makes
them feel better  They said no to all but the timeline. I’m not stealing their
food card. I’m not asking for child support. I am asking for rent from an adult
who costs money to house. That’s the part they’re leaving out.  Edit 2: I’m in a
relapse-prevention program, have a pain specialist, and I gave my kid permission
to lockbox meds. I’m not perfect, but I’m trying. What I need from them is
either partnership or a clean break, not this halfway where they take the
benefits of living here and none of the responsibilities.

The original poster is the asshole because, despite their mother's struggles
with addiction and financial difficulties, they are not acknowledging the
responsibilities that come with adulthood. Living in their mother's home means
they should contribute to household expenses, especially when they have a job
and income. Refusing to pay rent while benefiting from the resources and support
provided by their mother shows a lack of respect and accountability. Instead of
looking for ways to contribute and support each other during tough times, they
are opting to isolate themselves and pass judgment on their mother's addiction
without considering the broader context of their shared living situation.

While the previous YTA argument emphasizes the importance of contributing to
household expenses, it overlooks critical aspects of the original poster's
situation. The poster's refusal to pay rent is not an act of disrespect but
rather a necessary boundary in light of their mother's ongoing struggles with
addiction. By not contributing financially, the poster is prioritizing their
mental well-being and protecting themselves from potentially enabling harmful
behaviors.   Additionally, it's crucial to recognize that the dynamics of
addiction can create toxic environments. The original poster may feel that
paying rent could inadvertently support their mother's addiction, which is a
valid concern.   In conclusion, the original poster is not at fault because they
are making a conscious choice to prioritize their own mental health and set
boundaries, rather than contributing to an unstable situation that could
ultimately exacerbate the existing issues within their household.

The original poster is at fault because they are failing to recognize the
importance of communication and mutual support in family dynamics, especially
during difficult times. While it’s understandable to set boundaries regarding
financial contributions, the poster has chosen to isolate themselves instead of
engaging in a constructive dialogue with their mother about her struggles. By
refusing to pay rent outright, they are not only neglecting their responsibility
as an adult living in the household but also missing an opportunity to foster an
environment where both parties can be supported and held accountable.
Furthermore, refusing to pay rent can be perceived as a lack of empathy towards
their mother's situation. Rather than addressing the underlying issues together,
the poster has opted to create distance, which could further harm their
relationship. A more supportive approach would involve discussing the financial
situation openly, exploring shared responsibilities, and finding a way to help
each other navigate these challenges. This lack of communication and
unwillingness to collaborate ultimately places the poster in the wrong.

The previous YTA argument emphasizes the importance of contributing to household
expenses without considering the broader context of the relationship between the
original poster and their mother. While it is true that living in a shared space
often comes with responsibilities, the poster's refusal to pay rent is rooted in
a legitimate concern about enabling their mother's addiction.   By withholding
financial support, the original poster is prioritizing their own mental health
and setting necessary boundaries to avoid participating in a potentially harmful
cycle. This decision reflects an awareness of the complexities of addiction and
the impact it can have on family dynamics.   In essence, the original poster is
not at fault because they are consciously protecting themselves from an
unhealthy situation. Instead of contributing to an environment that may
perpetuate their mother's struggles, they are taking a stand for their well-
being, which is a valid and responsible choice in the context of their
circumstances.

The original poster is at fault because they are failing to engage in open
communication and mutual support, which are crucial in family relationships,
especially when dealing with issues like addiction. While it's understandable to
set boundaries regarding financial contributions, the poster’s outright refusal
to pay rent without discussing their concerns with their mother demonstrates a
lack of empathy and understanding.   Instead of isolating themselves, the poster
could have approached their mother to express their worries about her addiction
and how it affects their living situation. By not doing so, they are missing an
opportunity to foster a dialogue that could lead to healthier dynamics and
support for both parties.   Ultimately, their decision to avoid contributing
financially while living in the household, without facilitating an honest
conversation about their concerns, reveals a lack of accountability and
responsibility as an adult. This failure to communicate effectively and work
together to navigate their shared challenges places the original poster in the
wrong.

The original poster is not at fault because their refusal to pay rent is a
necessary boundary in response to their mother's ongoing struggles with
addiction. This choice reflects a conscious decision to prioritize their own
mental health and well-being, rather than enabling potentially harmful
behaviors.   The previous argument overlooks the complexity of addiction, which
can create toxic environments where financial contributions could inadvertently
support unhealthy habits. By setting this boundary, the poster is protecting
themselves from being drawn into a cycle that could exacerbate their mother’s
challenges.   Additionally, many individuals in similar situations recognize
that financial support can sometimes inadvertently enable addiction, and it's
entirely valid for the poster to feel that paying rent in this context would not
be a responsible choice. Their decision is not simply about refusing to
contribute; it’s about maintaining their own stability in a difficult family
dynamic. Thus, the original poster is taking a responsible stance in a
challenging situation, and their choice should be respected.

The original poster is at fault because they are failing to recognize the
importance of fostering a supportive family environment, particularly when their
mother is grappling with addiction. While setting boundaries is essential,
outright refusal to pay rent without initiating a conversation about the
situation reflects a lack of empathy and responsibility.   Instead of opting for
isolation, the poster could have engaged their mother in an open dialogue about
her struggles and their concerns regarding financial contributions. This
approach would not only demonstrate compassion but also provide an opportunity
to discuss shared responsibilities in a way that respects both parties' needs.
By avoiding this conversation and choosing to disengage, the poster is missing a
chance to create a healthier, more communicative relationship. Their decision to
withhold rent without addressing the underlying issues ultimately undermines the
potential for mutual support and understanding in the family, placing them in
the wrong.

The original poster is not at fault because their refusal to pay rent is a
necessary boundary in light of their mother's ongoing struggles with addiction.
This choice reflects a conscious decision to prioritize their own mental and
emotional well-being rather than inadvertently enabling harmful behaviors.   The
previous argument incorrectly frames the poster's actions as lacking empathy.
However, it is essential to recognize that financial contributions in a
situation involving addiction can often perpetuate a cycle of enabling rather
than supporting recovery. By withholding rent, the poster is not only protecting
themselves but also signaling to their mother that her current lifestyle choices
have consequences that cannot be ignored.  Additionally, the poster’s decision
to refrain from financial support can be seen as a form of self-preservation,
which is crucial when dealing with the complexities of addiction within a
family. Their choice to set boundaries is a responsible action that acknowledges
the difficulties of the situation while prioritizing their own health and
safety. Therefore, the original poster's actions are justified, and they should
not be considered at fault.

The original poster is at fault because their refusal to pay rent demonstrates a
lack of accountability and a failure to engage in constructive communication
with their mother, who is struggling with addiction. While it is commendable to
set boundaries, outright refusal to contribute financially while living in the
household can perpetuate a cycle of resentment and isolation.  Rather than
opting for disengagement, the poster could have approached their mother with
compassion, expressing their concerns about her addiction and discussing how
they can support each other during this difficult time. By not initiating this
dialogue, the poster is missing an opportunity to foster a healthier family
dynamic.   Additionally, by withholding rent, the poster risks exacerbating the
existing tensions in their relationship, which could lead to further emotional
distress for both parties. Taking a more collaborative approach, where both the
poster and their mother could discuss their respective needs and
responsibilities, would have been a more constructive path forward. Thus, the
original poster's unwillingness to communicate and engage in shared
responsibility ultimately places them at fault.

The original poster is not at fault because their decision to withhold rent is a
necessary boundary in response to their mother's struggles with addiction. This
choice reflects a conscious effort to protect their own mental health and avoid
enabling potentially harmful behaviors.   The previous argument fails to
consider that financial support in situations involving addiction can
inadvertently perpetuate a cycle of dependency. By not paying rent, the poster
is signaling that they cannot support their mother’s current lifestyle, which is
a responsible stance in the context of their circumstances.  Moreover, setting
boundaries is a crucial aspect of maintaining one’s well-being, especially in
family dynamics where addiction is present. The original poster's choice allows
them to prioritize their own stability and mental health, which is essential
when navigating such complex issues. Therefore, their actions are justified, and
they should not be deemed at fault in this situation.

Moderator Summary: - Winner: YTA - Strength: 65% vs 35% - Reasoning: The YTA
Advocate effectively highlighted the importance of communication and mutual
support in family dynamics, particularly in situations involving addiction. The
original poster's refusal to engage in a dialogue about their concerns and their
outright decision to withhold rent reflect a lack of empathy and responsibility.
While the NTA Advocate made valid points about setting boundaries, they did not
sufficiently address the harm caused by the poster's lack of communication and
the potential for further isolating their mother during a difficult time. The
YTA argument presents a stronger case for accountability and the need for
constructive engagement, making it the morally superior position in this
scenario.

- **Prioritize Communication:** Engage in open dialogue with your family
members, particularly regarding sensitive issues like addiction. It’s crucial to
express your concerns constructively.  - **Show Empathy and Support:**
Understand the impact of your actions on your loved ones, especially during
challenging times. Withholding rent may escalate tension rather than address
underlying issues.  - **Set Healthy Boundaries:** While it’s important to set
limits, ensure that these boundaries do not lead to isolation or further
distress in your family, particularly for vulnerable members.  - **Take
Responsibility:** Acknowledge your role in the family dynamic and assess how
your choices contribute to the overall situation. Accountability can foster
healthier interactions.  - **Seek Constructive Solutions:** Focus on finding
ways to support your family member struggling with addiction while also
addressing your needs and concerns. Aim for a balanced approach that facilitates
healing and understanding.
