=== QUERY ===
I’m just curious cause it bothered me. I liked this one creator. He’s a
competitive gamer and he’s really good at this certain team game. I’m a gamer
myself but I don’t consider myself good at this game. Well I got him in my game
I was so excited because wow he’s a pretty big creator and I’m playing against
him. I beat him twice. I went to his discord and sent him a message along the
lines of “ his I saw you in my game ! And I beat you twice gg!“ and I left a
little funny emoji. I didn’t mean any harm I just thought it was cool that I
seen him and I actually won against him. But he just gave me a rude response
like “ well win me 1v1, and the only reason you won is because I wasn’t playing
with my friends, when I said I didn’t mean any harm he said something like “
well don’t come up in here saying that unless you wanna beat me 1v1 or
something. I want playing with my friends either but still I thought he was
super rude over this game or was I the asshole for my message ?

Hey Reddit this is something that has been on my mind and I feel like I need to
share. I(24f) and Tay(23f) have been friends for almost 9 years. I was added to
a friend group online by a friend that had her and 4 other people were in. Me
and Tay hit it off outside the group and became best friends. I never had any
close friends due to being bullied, so having someone I can see as a sister,
made my life better. Tay tended to be bossy and when things didn’t go her way,
there was a melt down. So to avoid any fights, I went along with her.The group
slowly broke off due to a lot of issues but me and her stayed together. Over
time I went to go visit her a couple of times and we had a blast everytime.
Then she found this game called phasaphobia. If you don’t know, it’s like you
have to go into different maps and find the type of ghost and leave. Well I got
into it way more than her and played it when she wasn’t on. I started getting
better equipment and leveling up fast. The next time we got on and she saw how
much I played, she told me that she wants to only use her level equipment
because if she used mine, she considered it cheating. I said it’s fine and it
didn’t bother me because I didn’t have that much upgraded anyway.  Over time, I
played it more and more and got way better at the game and can see the the
higher the equipment, the better it was to find ghosts. I was at least at level
40 and she was still at only level 12. So the next time she decided to play, I
told her,”hey I noticed the higher equipment makes things easier, why don’t we
use my equipment since I have a lot of money to spend?”. She blew up saying that
no it’s cheating and we need to do it with her equipment and that if we don’t
then she won’t play.  I told her she’s getting worked up and that it’s not
cheating that I wanted to use the higher equipment. She started saying I was
disrespecting her boundaries and that I didn’t care how she felt. That resulted
into a screaming argument and I told her that she needs to chill it’s just a
game and that I’ll talk to her in the morning once she calms down. She yelled
saying if I hung up then it’s over and I told her fine and ended the call.  That
was over a month ago, AITA?  Edit: I read what you guys said and that there’s a
couple things isn’t wanted to say and also I didn’t say what was said in the
argument because I didn’t know if Reddit had a limit or if my post would be
taken down. I have only bought it up twice, so I always played it how she wanted
to play it. The second time I was trying to tell her that the higher equipment
was better and I had more money so was trying to help her level up. Also I just
wanted her to at least try it once because I wanted to try it my way like how we
play it her way. In the argument, i did try to compromise and I asked “ok we can
use the lower equipment but can I at least use the level two spirit box because
it’s always me using it?”. She refused saying that EVERYTHING needs to be level
one and that it needs to be her way. I tried asking why couldn’t I use just one
thing and she wouldn’t listen. This isn’t the first time we fought like this but
that’s different stories

Title: AITA for being mad at my best friend

I (22F) am best friends with 22M. We’ve been friends since around 2017 when the
Nintendo switch came out. It bonded us during school and we’ve been friends ever
since.   We’ve gone through a lot of changes, from school to university, to jobs
to partners to friends.   Cut to now and I’m kind of pissed off at him. Since
being at uni he’s never been the best replier and he also has a partner,
friends, activities. But I feel like whenever I text him, I’m always the first
to do so, he doesn’t send nor look at anything I send on socials (we used to be
avid reels senders). We do movie nights to catch up as we don’t live close to
each other, and we haven’t had one in ages. I messaged about doing one and he
was like ‘maybe this day’ and I messaged about a few times and he’d made other
plans.   Maybe I’m just hormonal and missing my best friend. And like I get he’s
busy but considering I’m the best friend, I feel like I’m not even probably
thought about that much. The most active he’s been was when I got a girlfriend
and then since that’s been the new normal he’s dropped off again. (I can confirm
that it wouldn’t be because of that, as again we both have partners and
gayness).  Am I being the asshole for being a bit mad about this - does anyone
have any advice.  Part of me is thinking not to reach out until he messages me
now but I don’t know if I’m just being bitter. Or in general if I’m being too
clingy here when some people barely speak to their best friend that much. Plus I
know friendships with men are super different to women.

Title: WIBTA if I ban my roommate’s boyfriend from staying the night?

First time posting on Reddit cause all my friends are asleep. I roommate (M19)
am a college and like many have a roommate. We were randomly assigned and I got
a reasonable roommate (F19). She was seeing this guy (M20) and I was fine with
him spending the night sometimes. He seemed fine to be so I didn’t really care.
Over the past few weeks he has been getting really upset/angry at something
(usually something me or my roommate said) with not communication of why, being
overall unhygienic, and overly blunt to the point of coming off as a bit rude.
I’ve been trying to let it slide since I’m typically not one for confrontation
but it’s gotten to the point where sleepovers are a nightmare. Not to get to
deep but I am a very traumatized person, so if I do not feel safe around someone
sleeping/going to sleep I cannot sleep. I do not feel 100% safe around him and
because of this it has made any time he spends the night my own personal hell,
this lack of sleep on top of my pre-existing chronic illness has caused me to
feel sick. But I don’t want him to feel like he’s not welcome/hurt my roommates
feelings as he’s over what feels like a reasonable amount. But I don’t want this
to mess with college. So tell me would I be the asshole?

Title: AITA for talking behind my coach's back while she was near?

Post ID: 1odr3g1

During the school season, I was in a soccer club team with all of my best
friends. We've been on this team since last year, with the same coaches and
teammates. Throughout the season, our one coach Rebecca has been kind of off
from the start with me specifically. Flashback to a year ago, I tried out for a
higher club division in the summer and I ended up not making it despite having
similar athleticism, skill, and positivity as others who made it - Rebecca was
coaching that team that year. It obviously was devastating since soccer means a
lot to me and I really wanted to make that team but this didn't mean I was
putting others who made it down or talking negatively in any sort about the
people involved in the situation.   So when this year's season started, I
already had let go of the summer and what had happened, and was playing with a
good mindset and positivity. I was cheering others on the best I could, being
polite to all coaches including Rebecca, and pushing myself at every practice
and tournament. However, I could already sense Rebecca didn't really like me as
much as the other people on my team or that something was off but I didn't
understand why because I've never done anything to her that past year (turns out
I was right). My coach also tends to be on the harsher side and visibly had
favourites last year and they aren't on the team this year. Another issue we had
this season was the fact that there was a mix-up about who captains were. Long-
story short, it was originally me, and my other friend but it got switched
arbitrarily to other people, as coaches don't really care about who captains are
as long as there are three. That also caused a bit of drama which will be
relevant later on.   One tournament day, all four of us "captains" were going to
go talk to the other team's captains but Rebecca gave a bit of a dismissive
opinion that only two of us should go. I understand more than two captains is a
bit absurd, but I felt like I couldn't have a say in who should go and what.
After the game, I went to my friends and shared how I felt about how Rebecca
worded things and how it felt a bit harsh and unnecessary. I wasn't aware that
Rebecca overheard our conversation and next practice it became a rule that no
captains were allowed anymore. I talked to the coaches about it and their
reasoning made sense but I felt that there was no value in doing that because it
just made team tension worse. One other coach fully understood how me and my
friends felt, and agreed that it might have been overboard. AITA for how things
turned out? AITA for just stating my opinion on something with my close friends?
