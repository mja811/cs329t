=== QUERY ===
So I'm friends with this guy that I've known since kindergarten. He got married
some years ago and now him and his wife have a little baby girl and she's
currently at toddler age. I come over often enough that I'm used to seeing the
little bugger and she's great. I don't have any other little kids from family or
anything in my life so it's been great seeing a little human grow.   Every once
in a blue moon they ask me to watch her for a few hours while my friend and his
wife get some date time or whatver they need to do. So I was hanging out with
her and I know that they've been trying to get her to take her first steps. I
read about a trick where if you make them hold something then they will walk
without holding onto a surface. So I gave her a toy and filmed it and it
worked!   I sent the video to them and my friend didn't care, he was just happy
but his wife was pissed! She was mad at me that they weren't there for that big
moment. I don't have the type of relationsbio with her where I can have a deep 1
on 1 with her but I talked to my friend about it and he's not upset with me but
his wife still is. She thinks I robbed her if a key moment. I did het it on film
but I get what she's saying.   I had no malicious intent but was I the AH for
getting the toddler to take those first steps? I hi estoy didn't think the trick
would work but it did.

I don’t have kids so I wanted to gauge how I turn out in this story. I have a
nephew that is 2yo and 2 days ago was the first time I was asked by my sister to
babysit. (I had been asking to babysit since he was born). I was super excited
and moved my work schedule so I could do it. Note: when anyone is asked to
babysit, her Husband is always home. He works at home and they have someone
babysit so he can focus on working.  The babysitting was for a couple hours in
the morning, everything seemed to go well. I had checked with my sister
beforehand to ask if I could take my nephew to the park a half block away. Her
husband said to just let him know when I was taking him. I did. I was also asked
to babysit yesterday, again everything went fine. Fast forward to today, I was
asked to babysit again. (My BIL was home) I texted him to let him know I was
taking my nephew for a walk.   So this is where AITA comes in. He called me a
couple minutes later asking where I was at, clearly angry. He said they really
prefer if people ask permission before taking their son anywhere because “you
just freak out if your kid is gone”. I said I could definitely bring him back no
problem. He said no it’s fine, I’m just saying. (Annoyed/angry the whole time)
When I got back he didn’t come upstairs through the whole time even up to when I
left their house. I also told my sister about the situation and she said its
better if I phrase things as a question.. Again I don’t think I’m in the wrong
because I did text beforehand and the park is literally just a half block away
in an enclosed neighborhood. But I also don’t have kids so I don’t know if it’s
normal? AITA?

Old playground, new equipment. The area is suburban. Grew up literally 3 houses
from this park. Myself (41f), my son (8m), husband(42m) and dog were all at
park.   I was attending to my son on the playground, he wanted me there, nearby,
to take pics of his jumps.  He pointed out a specific swing there is only one of
on the playground. Ppl were on it. We played on other things. I waited for it
while he swang some more. It became available and I went to get it.  A younger
girl met me at the swing doing the same thing. My son was just getting off the
other swing l, so I told her, you go ahead, I'll get next.  Cut to 25 minutes
later, and her and her cousins really seeming to enjoy watching me wait. No
concern for my kid who is now plopped down, as we've now done everything else
and still waiting.  My husband has also now been watching us wait while with our
dog at a table.  Finally, the young girl I initially gave a turn to started to
get off, so I go to grab it. She says, no,  we're not done. I say, ladies, we've
waiting 25 minutes. They say another friend wants a turn, I say she needs to
wait until my son and i were done. They flat out refuse.  I tell them, no really
its our turn. And older cousin (all these girls are likely 10-17) starts yelling
in my face saying I can't talk to them, their children etc. Finally their moms
come over,  start yelling at me, repeating their daughters, that I'm talking to
children, how dare I. I was stunned they flipped, totally ignoring their
children were acting like little brats.  I just walked away at tjat point, they
weren't going to hear my side that I was simply trying to be a village cause
their children were not taking turns. I got in the car and bawled my eyes out.
Silver lining, my husband and son went back and my son got his turn.  But my
god, I really don't think I was  in the wrong, I have a 13 year old and would
have wanted someone to tell him to let other ppl use the equipment.  Still,
AITA?

Title: AITA for refusing to pay a 100$ bill from my Sisters in laws?

So my sister and I planned a family vacation together. We rented a big house for
both our families. It was me, my wife, our 1 year old, our dog, and my sister
with her husband and their two kids who are 5 and 3. The house was big enough
that her in laws stayed with us during the first week and our parents came in
the second week.  Our dog is a rescue she is very sweet but gets nervous around
new people. She knows both our families really well and loves the kids and my
brother in law but she had never met his parents before. So we made it clear
that she would always be leashed when they were around and that my wife or I
would always be there.  Two days into the trip my sister’s MIL told me she is
great with dogs and asked me if she could give her a treat. I said yes but I
explained exactly how to do it safely. I told her to get down low so she would
not tower over the dog and to move slowly. She said okay but immediately did the
opposite. She leaned over her and reached down and the dog got scared and jumped
up on her. I pulled the dog back right away and told her that for the rest of
the week it would be better if she did not try to interact with the dog.  She
seemed fine with that so I thought that was the end of it.  Two days later
everyone else was out. It was just me, our baby, Sisters MIL+FIL and one of the
older kids in the house. I was on the floor playing with my kid when I heard
them talking very loudly at the dining table. It was that kind of loud where it
feels like they actually want you to hear it. They were saying things like we
will have to get it repaired when we get home and maybe we can find someone
cheap to fix it.  I could not really ignore it so I asked what was broken and
what needed fixing. She said that one of the kids had brought her her broken
ankle bracelet. She said she was not sure what happened. Maybe it broke while
she was on the trampoline or bumped into sonething, or maybe it was when the dog
jumped at her earlier that week.  I said oh okay that sucks and left it at that.
Nobody mentioned it again and the topic never came up once for the next 4 days
that they stayed.  Fast forward two weeks after the vacation. My sister called
me and said her in laws had a bracelet repaired and now they wanted me to send
them 100 dollars for the repair.  I was honestly shocked. I called my sisters
MIL right away and asked what that was about. She said she thought it must have
been the dog when she jumped up on her. I reminded her that she ignored my clear
instructions and that she was not even sure if it was the dog since she had
mentioned several other reasons.  I told her that if she had talked to me
honestly during the trip and said she thought my dog broke it I might have
helped pay. But she said nothing, waited two weeks, and then sent the bill. So I
told her no, I was not paying.  Now she is upset and told my sister I am an
asshole So Reddit. AITA?

So today I took my kids to get their shots, offered because alot of times my
wife struggles to sleep. So she can sleepin a bit . This gives her time to get
ready and once im done I meet her and she gets one of the kids and take to
school and I take the other (divide and conquer). In the past I usually go to
the cafeteria (Army hospital) after the shots to get food for lunch for myself
and whatever the kids want. I usually call my wife to ask if she wants anything
and every time she says no. Today I failed to call to ask and she goes off on me
as to why I didnt call her to ask and that she would have wanted a sandwich. Now
shes telling me cusing me out and dropping f bombs. I did apologize and admitted
I failed to call her and she continued and to not call her for the rest of the
day. Naturally I got upset too because here im focusing on trying to take care
of the kids, I even offered to take one of the kids to school because she was
going to take both (we both work and i was late in). I know im wrong to some
extent but is she overreacting? Am I the asshole?

Title: AITA for changing my daughters middle name
Score: 54
Post ID: 1octkde

Sorry about the long post guys, but this one has been eating at Me. I 31F and my
husband 34M are expecting our first baby in March. We found out really early
that we’re having a little girl and are super excited. However, there is the
problem of my mother-in-law for backstory my mother-in-law 57F has some serious
control issues to the point that she hijacked our wedding and basically tried to
make it what she wanted and now has effectively ruined most of the baby
milestones. We haven’t announced the pregnancy yet she decided to go tell the
family herself when we found out the gender. We told her and told her she to
keep her mouth shut. but it’s her first grandbaby and didn’t wanna keep it from
her. Well that’s where the problem started. We wanted to do a gender reveal
party mother-in-law tried to hijack that event again and forced us to do it at a
location that we weren’t comfortable with at her sister‘s house because we
stated we didn’t want to have the party there queue World War 3. She got over
the drama after my husband the saint that he is snapped on her. Now comes
planning for the baby shower once again trying to involve her sister who we have
no relationship with. We asked that the only stipulation we had was that we got
to do the food for it because we are both chefs queue the next meltdown. Now his
father 69m decided to get involved as he enables his wife. Husband and FIL get
into a huge screaming match, because that was our only concession. Well this is
where I may be the asshole. When we found out the gender, we decided on names we
picked something non-familial for her first name and her two middle names were
going to be my grandmother’s middle name and MIL’s middle name. Since she has
caused all this drama, I told my husband I don’t want MIL’s name attached to our
daughter as MIL has a tendency to be vindictive, cruel and narcissistic. Husband
agreed and we have since decided that daughter’s second middle name will be my
husband’s now late grandmother’s name am I the asshole for changing my
daughter’s middle name?  Edit for context: I’m done I will not control my
husband’s relationship with his parents but I’m done I wash my hands of them
they will not have a relationship with our daughter and I give not a single
crap. I will not subject my innocent child to that type of manipulation. Abuse,
or behavior, I don’t agree with her way of being and will not allow that as an
influence on my child. Period. I don’t tolerate poor behavior from my own family
I will not allow it from his at all. They will get no information at all and
hubs is on my side 100% we hate it has come to that but actions have
consequences
