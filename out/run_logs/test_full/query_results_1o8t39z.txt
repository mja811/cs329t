=== QUERY ===
My ex and I have a 12 year old daughter, Olivia, with autism level 2. My ex has
primary custody and I have Olivia on Wednesdays and every other weekend.   A few
months ago my ex told me she was feeling a little burnt out so she wanted us to
keep Olivia from Wednesday to Sunday so she could go on a trip with some
friends. Olivia is very attached to her mom, so my ex told Olivia that it was a
work trip and she had to go.   Last week one of my ex’s friends was at the house
with my ex and Olivia and their vacation somehow came up. Olivia figured out
that the vacation was the “work trip” that her mom told her about and freaked
out because her mom lied to her and her mom doesn’t lie.   She hid in her room
for the rest of the day, then called me and asked me to come get her. She’s been
with us ever since.   She’s really upset about this. She cries all the time
because she wants her mom but she doesn’t know what else her mom lied about and
she doesn’t trust her.   Apparently Olivia’s aide called my ex because she’s
been having a hard time in school so now my ex wife is demanding that I send
Olivia home so they can get back to her routines and start working with her
therapist to help her get over this but I told her Olivia will go back when
she’s ready. Now she’s threatening to call the police and/or take me back to
court over “custodial interference” even though we’ve always had a very friendly
co parenting relationship.   My wife thinks we should send her back to avoid
drama but I think it should be Olivia’s choice. AITA for refusing to send her
back after she found out her mom lied to her?

AITA? Needing some opinions if I am in the wrong here. I have been divorced 3
years this November. My ex mother in law and I don’t really have a close
relationship but we are always civil and I make sure my son stays very involved
with her as a grandmother. My ex mother in law is a Realtor and I looked at
homes with her in April but decided to wait and keep saving. Since then, I have
been having issues with my ex husband (I started dating again in may and he’s
livid) and so it has resulted in distancing myself from his family over the past
6 months due to their very vocal opinions of me dating again after 3 years of
being single.  I started looking at home again for various agents and last week
I reconnected with the builder (she introduced me to in April) and signed a
contract on a home he’s building . My son was very involved in this and out of
excitement let his dad know we are buying a house. Long story short, my ex
mother in law found out and called the builder behind my back demanding to be
added to the contract to get a commission (went on for 48 hours before I found
out) The builder obviously could not do this because one, she was not physical
there when the home was shown and she is not representing me. We never signed a
buyer/rep agreement. She tried emailing one that was back dated but I refused to
sign one, to me that is unethical and dishonest. I was very thankful she took
the time back in April to show me 2 homes but we were in such a different place
in our relationship and I also want to add she repeatedly told me she was going
to waive her commission and put it toward closing costs. She harassed me for
days over this and my ex husband withheld my child from me and we missed a paid
for vacation last week to visit family (we have a decree but have never followed
it) so since it was technically his time I lost out on the whole trip. I have
been told they will no longer help me when needed etc etc. After not being to
see or speak to my child for days, I called the builder and begged him to add
her because of the drama it was causing which he declined to do so on ethics. As
of today I backed out of the home, it was a week of emotional turmoil which I
thought buying my first home as a single mother would be a happy time. It is. Is
being spun by my exes entire family I did her wrong and karma will be paid back.
AITA for not getting her back involved?

Hi, I’m [22 F] new to Reddit so please forgive me if my post is not up to Reddit
standards. I wanted to ask if I am the asshole for telling my mother she
should’ve just stayed in California.   Basically, she went on a week and half
long vacation with her fiancee and while she was gone, I took care of my three
younger siblings who are 14,16, and 18. This means sending them to school and
work outside of our usual driving to hang out and things of the sort. I don’t
mind doing this, I love my siblings and although gas is expensive and I’m not
really making that much money, I do what I can because I know there is no one
else to help.   We had a really peaceful week; we all delegated tasks and knew
what chores to do and yes they fought here and there, but it was actually really
nice to have them both gone. I picked them both up from the airport tonight and
I already knew it was going to be bad when we got home.   I will admit, I didn’t
do some things my mother wanted me to do before she left (moving some of my new
furniture downstairs into my room), but other than that, we kept the entire
house clean and even cleaned and cooked before she came back to make sure when
she came home it would be less stressful.   My mother and her fiancee ate dinner
but I could tell she was already in a bad mood, which is understandable after a
long flight, but when she got out of the shower and saw my little sister looking
for her AirPods rather than being asleep (it was only 10:30 pm) she just kinda
went off on us both. Talking about how she does too much for us and how she
should’ve just stayed in California and how we didn’t even clean the bathroom.
My younger sister told her that yes she should’ve just stayed over there since
she clearly doesn’t want to be here and I will admit I felt hurt, this isn’t the
first time she’s done something like this after being away. I told her that the
next she time she leaves to go on vacation or wherever she goes to just stay
until she’s happy or just not come back at all because she always does this and
it drags everyone’s mood down and that we did our best to keep the house clean
and that I don’t know what it was she wanted from us but it doesn’t matter
because she’s like this every time she comes back.  She didn’t say anything and
now I am wondering if I am the asshole for saying those things?

Title: AITA for speaking up!

Let’s start from the beginning. I joined the family back in 2018/2019. I
instantly noticed the dynamic in the house was different. It was a 3 bedroom
home with 8 people living there including  2 toddlers. The initial plan was my
brother in law and his family were staying till they get back on there feet… 8
years later and here we are still same position. So recently a lot of lies have
been brought to the family’s attention about him and his wife. Stating they are
taking care of the bills that are in my mother in laws name however every-bill
is on pink… his 2 nieces “room” is really the daylight room with a massive 6ft
window.  Now let’s get to the AITA. Recently my mother in law has been venting
to us about how she feels the strain from taking care of the girls because she
the one who feeds them, bathe them, takes care of them when sick. I told her son
my husband we needed to say something. We then found out his brother lied about
going on a work trip and really took a paid vaca “by himself”. Two weeks later
his wife took vaca “by herself”. We confronted his brother and told him how this
was not right and I said a lot more details about things I knew about like the
coworker he was cheating on his wife with… I believe she is cheating as well bc
once she found out nothing was done at all.   Well yesterday my mother in law
called us to see if we could babysit the girls bc they “got sick” and were
dropped off at the house even tho grandma and grandpa had plans.   We sent them
a text asking why one of them could not take off a couple of hours to watch the
girls. They both proceeded to claim they couldn’t bc the vaca they individually
took. I told them it sounded like a personal problem but that this was not okay
bc they just ruined the grandparents plans. They both called grandma and got mad
at her for calling us bc it was “not our concern”. We then told them it was bc
mom called and then they changed tunes saying “she misunderstood and
miscommunicated to y’all what’s happening”. We said there no miscommunication
y’all did a drop off with out actually asking then they both called individually
saying they were on the way home and it’s under control. I said it’s under
control because we said something but what’s y’all plan so we know if we need to
go. Sister in law says “I’m on the way home right now”. She picked up the girls
at 1:30 went back to work till 3:30 and claimed she was getting off at 4:30. If
she got off early after we said something why not that be the initial plan. So
they both said “thanks for y’all concern and since watching the girls is such a
big inconvenience we will never ask y’all for help again” mind you they have
never asked us for help they always just leave and expect grandma and grandpa to
watch.   GMA and gpa are so scared to say something because they have taken the
girls away before from there other grandparents when they lived with them bc
they didn’t get there way.   AITA for saying something.  Ps. They are both
managers at the place they work for and grandparents are 75 &amp;78 years old.
This is also our first time saying something in the past 6/7 years, we do not
live there and haven’t since they moved in.

Title: AITA for being extremely upset with my friend for choosing my ex bsf

For context, I (17F) and my friend (16F) have been friends since we were 4 and
5. Things didn't really change until last year. My old best friend \[Ill call
her Alice\] and I became super close about two years ago. we bonded over a toxic
person who hurt us both in the same way. But everything shifted when I got a
boyfriend. I've never been boy-crazy; I just happened to get into a relationship
first, and she blew up over it. After that, Alice changed a lot and started to
obsessively try and change to find a boyfriend. When my boyfriend and I
eventually broke up, she completely dropped me and started calling me toxic,
weird, fat, ugly, etc.   Now onto the friend I'm currently having issues with
\[I'll call her Natasha.\] She has really attached herself to Alice. Natasha has
had a rough family life and is usually staying at someone's house. I want to
make it clear that I don't care that Natasha and Alice are friends. I was bummed
at first because we all used to be close, but ive accepted that part. The
problem now is that i've been feeling very lonely because Natasha is always with
Alice.   This week I had a church conference Thursday and Friday, and that was
what finally broke me. Natasha and Alice spent most of the time whispering to
each other and going in and out of the bathroom crying because the guy Natasha
is talking to his ex showed up and she had an issue with Natasha. Meanwhile I
just sat there and watched, waiting to be including in the conversation.
Newsflash that never happened. On the last day, I ended up having a breakdown
because I felt useless and unwanted. It feels like the only time Natasha talks
to me is when something is going wrong for her.   I don't need constant
attention; I just want *some* effort in return. I also know i've been petty or
rude at moments out of hurt, but whenever i try to talk to her she either walks
away or talks over me changing the topic. Without Natasha I have no friends, and
im scared of losing her too.   Now I don't know what to do. I just feel stupid
and like i'm a bad friend, even though i've looked over the situation a hundred
times and can't figure out what I actually am doing that is wrong besides trying
to communicate my feelings.   So.. AITA?

Title: AITA For telling my mother that my little brother (13) should not get many(if any) Christmas gifts this year.

So this year has been rough for my family. My mother is a single parent of 4
including me (16f), my two brothers, and sister. I am the oldest of her children
and been having to step up lately.  Earlier this year him and my mother had a
fight about his screen time. It has always been 1 hour on vr for everyone,
including me but he has always had trouble listening to this rule. He normally
gets angry when I try to rush him off after he passes and hour and when I give
him an extra 5 mintues he still won’t get off when I tell him. At one point he
started getting in before my mother was awake or sneaking on without asking. Him
and my mother fought about how he needs to respect her rules or he can’t bring
use the headset or bring the one from his fathers house. My brothers dad doesn’t
care how much they go on electronics. My mom and their dad switch weeks with
them on Sunday's each week. My youngest brother(11m) doesn’t ever think the
rules are unfair.  When my mother and brother had an argument about the rules he
went to his dads the next day like normal but when it came the night to pick him
up, his father told my mother that he wouldn’t come, he didn’t feel comfortable.
My mom was asking for a reason since it was the week of spring break but my
brothers dad said he was scared of when she left at night to see her friends
(which she does once a month) even though I am here and capable of texting her
if something’s wrong and we have big dogs to protect us. All me and my siblings
don’t mind when she has left in the past since she returns before 12 and is
never drunk or acting wild, she always checks in and makes sure everyone is okay
beforehand.  My mother went to talk to him and see if he would come to our house
or just talk but at their fathers house, his father tried making my mother talk
to him through the screen door as him and his wife listened. Long story short he
started getting persuaded to go with my mother but saw his father and closed up.
Just so everyone knows, his father is a narcissist (professionally diagnosed)
and him and his wife have been discreetly harassing my mother for months.   My
mother was absolutely heart broken because she loves her children and does her
best, the whole situation making her mental state much worse. For the next few
months she only saw him during his sports games and she would cry after, clearly
distressed and wanting to see him more. She and my brothers dad went to court.
He tried to get full custody of one, key word, one of my brothers while
supervised visits from my mom. He didn’t talk about his other son which made it
more suspicious. To shorten this, the judge told him he had to make my brothers
come to our house. My brothers dad didnt exactly listen but after another court
session my brother slowly started coming back.   Lately is the problem: My
brother come to our house he acts like rules dont apply to him, he can eat junk
food, doesnt have to do chores, and can just sit on his phone (that wasnt even
supposed to be at our house but after an incident, it is). Now all hes been
talking about are gifts and things he wants even though he doesnt do anything.
AITA for thinking he shouldn’t have gifts after how he has impacted my mother
and our family life?  Edit: Yes, I know I shouldn’t be trying to parent but my
mom has been giving into all his wishes he’s asked for and after his fathers
words towards her, hasn’t been parenting him how she used to and how she does
us. I haven’t said anything yet but have been inching towards mentioning his
behavior. I’m taking all comments into consideration.
