--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: So I'm friends with this guy that I've known
since kindergarten. He got married some years ago and now him and his wife have
a little baby girl and she's currently at toddler age. I come over often enough
that I'm used to seeing the little bugger and she's great. I don't have any
other little kids from family or anything in my life so it's been great seeing a
little human grow.   Every once in a blue moon they ask me to watch her for a
few hours while my friend and his wife get some date time or whatver they need
to do. So I was hanging out with her and I know that they've been trying to get
her to take her first steps. I read about a trick where if you make them hold
something then they will walk without holding onto a surface. So I gave her a
toy and filmed it and it worked!   I sent the video to them and my friend didn't
care, he was just happy but his wife was pissed! She was mad at me that they
weren't there for that big moment. I don't have the type of relationsbio with
her where I can have a deep 1 on 1 with her but I talked to my friend about it
and he's not upset with me but his wife still is. She thinks I robbed her if a
key moment. I did het it on film but I get what she's saying.   I had no
malicious intent but was I the AH for getting the toddler to take those first
steps? I hi estoy didn't think the trick would work but it did.

YTA: The author of the post is an asshole because, despite having no malicious
intent, they disregarded the significance of a milestone moment for the child's
parents. By facilitating the child’s first steps without the parents present,
the author robbed them of a cherished experience that they would have wanted to
share together, which can create lasting feelings of resentment and
disappointment for the mother.

NTA: Refuting YTA's argument: While it's true that the milestone of a child's
first steps is significant, the author did not intentionally exclude the parents
from this moment. The author likely believed that they were supporting the child
in a natural developmental process, not realizing the emotional impact it would
have on the parents. The intent behind the action matters greatly in this
context; the author’s motivation was likely rooted in care and encouragement,
rather than a disregard for the parents’ experiences.   New argument: The author
also demonstrated a willingness to engage with the parents afterwards,
recognizing their feelings and the importance of the moment. This shows that the
author values the family dynamic and is open to communication, which indicates a
lack of malice. In a similar scenario, one commenter noted that "intent and
communication are key; if the author had reached out to the parents afterward to
share the joy of the moment, it mitigates any perceived wrongdoing" (Comment
#3). This reflects that the author's actions stemmed from support, not
selfishness, further reinforcing that they are not an asshole in this situation.

disappointment for the mother.  Refuting NTA's argument: While the author may
not have intended to exclude the parents, their actions show a blatant disregard
for the parents' feelings and the importance of shared experiences in a child's
development. The fact that the author chose to prioritize their own moment of
joy over the parents' desires is self-centered. They should have considered how
vital this moment was for the parents, particularly the mother, who might feel
left out and hurt.  New argument: The author’s approach also demonstrates a lack
of respect for the parents' role in their child's life. By taking it upon
themselves to facilitate such a pivotal moment without parental involvement,
they undermined the parents' position and authority. In a similar comment, one
user pointed out, "It's not just about the moment; it's about the respect for
the parents as caregivers" (Comment #5). This highlights that the author's
actions were inconsiderate and dismissive, making them an asshole in this
scenario.

NTA: NTA says: Refuting YTA's argument: While the milestone of a child's first
steps is undoubtedly significant, the author did not intentionally exclude the
parents from this moment. They likely believed they were supporting the child in
a natural developmental process, not realizing the emotional impact it would
have on the parents. The author's motivation was rooted in care and
encouragement, rather than a disregard for the parents’ experiences.   New
argument: Additionally, the author showed a willingness to communicate and share
the experience with the parents afterward. This demonstrates that the author
values the family dynamic and is open to dialogue, which indicates a lack of
malice. In a similar scenario, one commenter stated, "Intent matters, and if the
author genuinely meant to support and celebrate the child's achievement, that
shows a positive intention" (Comment #2). This reflects that the author’s
actions stemmed from a supportive place, further reinforcing that they are not
an asshole in this situation.

YTA: YTA says: The author of the post is an asshole because they prioritized
their own joy and involvement over the emotional significance of the moment for
the child's parents. By facilitating the child's first steps without the parents
present, the author not only diminished the parents' experience but also risked
creating feelings of resentment. This event is a milestone that parents cherish,
and by excluding them, the author acted selfishly, showing a lack of
consideration for the family's emotional bond.  Refuting NTA's argument: While
the intent behind the author's actions may not have been malicious, the failure
to consider the parents' feelings is an undeniable oversight. The author should
have recognized that some moments in a child's development are best shared with
the parents. The argument that they were simply supporting the child's growth
ignores the fact that these milestones are equally important to the parents and
should involve their participation.  New argument: Furthermore, the author’s
actions can be seen as undermining the parents' role in their child's life. By
taking it upon themselves to facilitate such a significant moment, they
effectively sidelined the parents, which can foster feelings of inadequacy or
exclusion. A similar comment noted, "It’s crucial to let parents have those
moments; it’s their child, after all" (Comment #4). This illustrates that the
author's self-centered approach was not just inconsiderate but also dismissive
of the parents' emotional investment, solidifying their status as the asshole in
this scenario.

NTA: NTA says: Refuting YTA's argument: While the YTA perspective emphasizes the
importance of shared experiences for the parents, it overlooks the fact that the
author acted out of genuine support for the child's developmental milestone. The
author likely did not intend to diminish the parents' experience but instead
aimed to encourage the child in a natural moment of growth. Moreover, the
author’s actions were not about seeking personal joy; they were about
celebrating the child’s achievement in the moment, which can happen in many
ways.  New argument: It’s also important to note that the author likely
anticipated sharing this moment with the parents afterwards, demonstrating a
commitment to inclusion rather than exclusion. In a similar situation, one
commenter stated, "If the author had celebrated the child’s first steps and then
involved the parents in the joy, it shows they care about the family dynamic"
(Comment #7). This emphasizes that the author’s intentions were rooted in
positivity and support, reinforcing that they are not an asshole in this
situation.

suggests that the author's intent was supportive, it fails to acknowledge that
intent does not excuse the impact of their actions. The author should have
recognized that being present for milestones like first steps is a fundamental
part of parenting. Ignoring the parents' emotional investment in this moment is
not just an oversight; it reflects a lack of empathy and understanding of the
family's dynamics.  New argument: Additionally, the author’s actions undermine
the parents' roles and authority in their child's life. By taking it upon
themselves to facilitate such a significant moment, they effectively sidelined
the parents, which can foster feelings of inadequacy or exclusion. In a similar
comment, one user pointed out, "Parents deserve to have those moments; it’s
their child, and they should be included in significant milestones" (Comment
#6). This illustrates that the author's self-centered approach was not only
inconsiderate but also dismissive of the parents' emotional investment,
solidifying their status as the asshole in this scenario.

NTA: NTA says: Refuting YTA's argument: While YTA emphasizes the importance of
parental involvement in milestone moments, it overlooks the fact that the author
likely did not intend to exclude the parents. Instead, the author acted out of a
desire to support the child's development. The situation unfolded naturally, and
the author may have believed they were fostering a positive environment for the
child rather than consciously sidelining the parents.  New argument: Moreover,
the author’s actions can be seen as an opportunity for the parents to celebrate
the child's achievement together later. By sharing the moment with the parents
afterwards, as many commenters have suggested, the author could turn what might
seem like a misstep into a shared joy. One commenter noted, "The best moments
can still be relived and celebrated as a family, even if they happen
unexpectedly" (Comment #3). This indicates that the author's approach, while
perhaps misguided, was not malicious and reflects a genuine interest in the
child's growth, supporting the idea that they are not an asshole.

the author's intent was supportive, this does not absolve them of the
responsibility to consider the parents' feelings. The fact that they chose to
engage with the child in such a pivotal moment without the parents present
indicates a significant disregard for the parents' role. Intent does not negate
the impact of their actions; they should have been more mindful of how important
such moments are for the family.  New argument: Furthermore, the author’s
actions undermine the parents' authority and emotional connection to their
child. By taking it upon themselves to facilitate this milestone, they
effectively sidelined the parents and diminished their involvement. A similar

(Comment #8). This perspective shows that the author’s actions, although perhaps
misguided, were not malicious, reinforcing that they are not an asshole in this
situation. The author acted with a supportive spirit and did not intend to
undermine the parents' role in their child's life.

believing they were fostering a positive environment. 2. The author showed a
willingness to communicate and celebrate the moment with the parents afterward,

in milestone moments, which YTA effectively underscores.  **Winner: YTA**
