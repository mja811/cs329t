--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: I am (20M) an international Actuarial
Science student currently in my third year of study of a 7 year  program.
Recently I received a call from my father telling me that he wants my 33 year
old brother to join me at school doing the program I am doing as a First year
and asking if it was possible for him to apply with his degree and results and
if I could help with that.   Some backstory on my brother is that he did go to
school for Business Management in my native country but has been struggling to
get a job. He wanted to do a masters but that didn't go through, (don't what to
bash my brother here but even with this degree he was on and off and would
decide when he would go to school or not, this caused him to spend nearly twice
as long the duration). After he finished he couldn't find a job and somewhere
along the line he gave up I guess.   He has been home doing nothing for like 7
years now. He was being encouraged by my other relatives to find a job, maybe in
a different field or least do something in the meantime. Multiple programmes,
courses etc popped up during those years but he rejected them saying he wants to
do something else.   Back to me now, So after my first year abroad I noticed how
my bills and tuition fees where putting a strain on my parents when I would go
back on holiday, this continued until one day I overheard them saying they had
taken a collateral loan on their car in order to make the deadline for my
tuitions. I asked what was going on and they tried to downplay saying that they
would always do this when they paid my fees and they had nearly payed back the
chain loans. It was always a stressful when due dates would I arrive and I had
to call them over and over asking for money.   I felt bad for them and decided I
needed to find a cheaper school as this situation was untenable. I spent close
to year looking for a cheaper school in the same country till I found it. So I
ended transferring from that better school to this one so that at least my
parents can breathe and save up for their pension as they quite older. The
situation became better but far from ideal, the major stress comes from things
like rent and groceries as money is still scarce.   Now fast forward to today,
NOW TELL ME WHY DO THEY SUDDENLY THINK THAT THEY CAN NOW DOUBLE THE AMOUNT THEY
CAN SPEND BY SENDING MY BROTHER HERE. I thought I had done the right thing by
proactively seeking cheaper schools and accommodation so that things are no
longer so tight and stressful to the wire. Now if they go through with this idea
it will be worse than before and I don't know if I can handle it.   I know I
sound so heartless and selfish to my own blood but, I know if they go through
with this my living standards will drastically worsen. I already receive no
pocket money or anything like that, the only cash I have is from the small
saving I have from transport costs when I decide to walk or wait for the evening
buses.

YTA: YTA - You seem selfish and ungrateful for the sacrifices your parents have
made for you, especially considering they are now asking for help for your
brother. You should be more understanding and willing to assist your family in
their time of need.

NTA: I disagree with the YTA's argument. The author is not selfish or ungrateful
for wanting to protect their own financial stability and boundaries. As
mentioned in example comment #3, it is important to prioritize one's own well-
being and not feel obligated to financially support family members, especially
if it could put a strain on their own financial situation. The author is
entitled to set boundaries and prioritize their own needs without being labeled
as selfish or ungrateful.

YTA: YTA - Your refusal to help your brother shows a lack of empathy and
compassion towards your own family. As seen in example comment #6, family should
always come first, and your unwillingness to assist your brother in his time of
need reflects poorly on your character. It is important to show support and care
for your family members, even if it requires some sacrifice on your part. Your
decision to prioritize your own financial stability over helping your brother is
selfish and makes you an asshole.

NTA: NTA says: I respectfully disagree with the YTA's argument. The author's
decision to prioritize their own financial stability does not necessarily
reflect a lack of empathy or compassion towards their family. As mentioned in
example comment #8, it is important to consider one's own well-being and
boundaries before sacrificing for others. The author is not obligated to provide
financial support if it puts a strain on their own financial situation. It is
possible to show empathy and compassion in other ways that do not involve
financial assistance. The author's decision does not make them an asshole, but
rather reflects a thoughtful consideration of their own needs and boundaries.

YTA: YTA says: YTA - Your unwillingness to help your brother in a time of need
is selfish and ungrateful. As mentioned in example comment #2, family should
always come first, and your refusal to assist your own sibling is a clear
indicator of your lack of empathy and compassion. It is important to prioritize
family relationships and support each other during tough times, even if it
requires some sacrifices on your part. Your actions make you appear selfish and
uncaring, which ultimately makes you an asshole.

NTA: NTA says: I respectfully disagree with the YTA's argument. The author's
decision to prioritize their own financial stability and boundaries does not
automatically make them selfish or ungrateful. As highlighted in example comment
#5, it is important to set boundaries and prioritize one's well-being, even
within family dynamics. The author is not obligated to provide financial
assistance if it puts their own financial stability at risk. It is possible to
show empathy and support in other ways that do not involve financial
contributions. The author's decision does not make them an asshole but rather
reflects a thoughtful consideration of their own needs and boundaries.

YTA: Based on the YTA comment #2, you are an asshole for not helping your
brother in a time of need, which shows a lack of empathy and compassion towards
your own family. Prioritizing your financial stability over assisting your
sibling reflects poorly on your character and makes you appear selfish and
uncaring. It is important to support family members during tough times and your
refusal to do so makes you an asshole.

NTA: NTA says: I respectfully disagree with the YTA's argument. The author's
decision to prioritize their own financial stability does not automatically make
them selfish or uncaring towards their family. As highlighted in example comment
#5, setting boundaries and ensuring one's own well-being is important. The
author is not obligated to provide financial assistance if it puts their own
financial security at risk. It is possible to show empathy and support in other
ways that do not involve monetary contributions. The author's decision is not
indicative of being an asshole but rather reflects a thoughtful consideration of
their own needs and boundaries.
