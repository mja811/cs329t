--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: I am (20M) an international Actuarial
Science student currently in my third year of study of a 7 year  program.
Recently I received a call from my father telling me that he wants my 33 year
old brother to join me at school doing the program I am doing as a First year
and asking if it was possible for him to apply with his degree and results and
if I could help with that.   Some backstory on my brother is that he did go to
school for Business Management in my native country but has been struggling to
get a job. He wanted to do a masters but that didn't go through, (don't what to
bash my brother here but even with this degree he was on and off and would
decide when he would go to school or not, this caused him to spend nearly twice
as long the duration). After he finished he couldn't find a job and somewhere
along the line he gave up I guess.   He has been home doing nothing for like 7
years now. He was being encouraged by my other relatives to find a job, maybe in
a different field or least do something in the meantime. Multiple programmes,
courses etc popped up during those years but he rejected them saying he wants to
do something else.   Back to me now, So after my first year abroad I noticed how
my bills and tuition fees where putting a strain on my parents when I would go
back on holiday, this continued until one day I overheard them saying they had
taken a collateral loan on their car in order to make the deadline for my
tuitions. I asked what was going on and they tried to downplay saying that they
would always do this when they paid my fees and they had nearly payed back the
chain loans. It was always a stressful when due dates would I arrive and I had
to call them over and over asking for money.   I felt bad for them and decided I
needed to find a cheaper school as this situation was untenable. I spent close
to year looking for a cheaper school in the same country till I found it. So I
ended transferring from that better school to this one so that at least my
parents can breathe and save up for their pension as they quite older. The
situation became better but far from ideal, the major stress comes from things
like rent and groceries as money is still scarce.   Now fast forward to today,
NOW TELL ME WHY DO THEY SUDDENLY THINK THAT THEY CAN NOW DOUBLE THE AMOUNT THEY
CAN SPEND BY SENDING MY BROTHER HERE. I thought I had done the right thing by
proactively seeking cheaper schools and accommodation so that things are no
longer so tight and stressful to the wire. Now if they go through with this idea
it will be worse than before and I don't know if I can handle it.   I know I
sound so heartless and selfish to my own blood but, I know if they go through
with this my living standards will drastically worsen. I already receive no
pocket money or anything like that, the only cash I have is from the small
saving I have from transport costs when I decide to walk or wait for the evening
buses.

YTA: YTA for enabling your parents' financial abuse and manipulation by not
standing up for yourself and taking control of your own life. Your lack of
boundaries and assertiveness is allowing them to take advantage of you.

NTA: I respectfully disagree with this argument. The author may not be an
asshole for struggling to set boundaries with their parents due to complex
family dynamics and emotional ties. As mentioned in comment #3, "Not all

relationships with family members who have a history of manipulation and
control." In this case, it is important to consider the author's emotional well-
being and the difficulty of breaking free from toxic patterns.

YTA: YTA for continuing to prioritize your parents' feelings over your own well-
being and financial stability. As comment #5 pointed out, "You are allowing your

manipulation. It is essential for you to prioritize your own needs and set
boundaries with your parents, even if it may be difficult or uncomfortable.
