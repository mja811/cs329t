--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: For context, I'm currently studying abroad
in university and I'm on my second year. I met this person within the first few
days of the semester and we got close ever since. We're from the same major,
which kinda helped with getting closer since we were in the same class.  This
semester, we got some new friends. These people are more of the party type, but
my friend barely drinks. (We'll call them Oliver to make it easier.) We've
invited Oliver to join us for drinks but they refused because: (1) They're not
gonna drink. (2) They want to call their partner at nighttime. (3) They don't
want to waste money, even for food.   Everything seemed fine up till we (new
friend gruop)started hanging out more. Me and Oliver would talk a lot about what
went down between people back then (last semester,) mostly funny incidents that
happened when we were intoxicated. But this time around was different. We had a
new friend group, not just random people that changes every weekend. There were
secrets involved, group chats, and (planned) trips.  Now that there's a group
chat without Oliver, I can't help but to feel bad, as if I've never invited them
to these gatherings. Oliver has also made it clear that even if it is free,
they'll never join us because of their partner. Not because their partner is
restricting them, but because they mainly call at night. This is another issue
that I have with Oliver. (I'll call Oliver's partner Jake.)   Everytime we go
out for food, Jake would call. It's not just a quick call, it can last up to 30
minutes and they'd do that repeatedly. I've tried telling Oliver that it makes
me feel like they're not valuing my time since we both have busy schedules.
Oliver would apologize but wouldn't do anything about it. I tried asking my
friend on what I should do in this situation, but they told me that I've done
enough and that Oliver should acknowledge what I said properly. It hasn't always
been this way, Oliver used to be such a good friend before they got into this
said relationship.   Back to the issue, Oliver has never once wanted to join us,
yet they always ask me about the tea that happened while we were drunk. I didn't
tell them anything. I'd feel horrible for telling them other people's secrets.
After telling them that I won't be doing that anymkre they said, "Oh so that's
how it is now." I'm not sure whether that's in a good/bad context. I tried
telling them that if they join our gatherings, then maybe we'll tell Oliver
about our drunk stories. Not sure if it'll actually happen, but based on their
reaction, it seemed like a no.   But now my concern is that Oliver will find out
about the other plans and feel offended that they're not 'invited.' I feel like
a terrible friend

YTA: You are the asshole because you are being passive-aggressive and not
communicating openly with Oliver about how you feel, instead choosing to exclude
them from group activities.

NTA: I disagree with the YTA's argument. The author may not be an asshole for
choosing to exclude Oliver from group activities if they feel uncomfortable or
unsafe around him. As stated in Example Comment #3, "Your safety and well-being
should always come first." It is important for the author to prioritize their
own feelings and boundaries in this situation.

understanding towards his feelings.

group activities based on your own assumptions, you are not giving him the
opportunity to address any concerns or misunderstandings.

Moderator Summary: YTA argues that the author is the asshole for being passive-
aggressive, not communicating openly with Oliver, prioritizing their own comfort
over being a supportive friend, assuming the worst about Oliver, being
dismissive of his feelings, and avoiding confrontation. NTA argues that the
author is not the asshole for prioritizing their own well-being, setting
boundaries, and prioritizing their own feelings and boundaries.   In this case,
NTA has the stronger argument as it emphasizes the importance of prioritizing
