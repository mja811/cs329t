--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: My ex and I have a 12 year old daughter,
Olivia, with autism level 2. My ex has primary custody and I have Olivia on
Wednesdays and every other weekend.   A few months ago my ex told me she was
feeling a little burnt out so she wanted us to keep Olivia from Wednesday to
Sunday so she could go on a trip with some friends. Olivia is very attached to
her mom, so my ex told Olivia that it was a work trip and she had to go.   Last
week one of my ex’s friends was at the house with my ex and Olivia and their
vacation somehow came up. Olivia figured out that the vacation was the “work
trip” that her mom told her about and freaked out because her mom lied to her
and her mom doesn’t lie.   She hid in her room for the rest of the day, then
called me and asked me to come get her. She’s been with us ever since.   She’s
really upset about this. She cries all the time because she wants her mom but
she doesn’t know what else her mom lied about and she doesn’t trust
her.   Apparently Olivia’s aide called my ex because she’s been having a hard
time in school so now my ex wife is demanding that I send Olivia home so they
can get back to her routines and start working with her therapist to help her
get over this but I told her Olivia will go back when she’s ready. Now she’s
threatening to call the police and/or take me back to court over “custodial
interference” even though we’ve always had a very friendly co parenting
relationship.   My wife thinks we should send her back to avoid drama but I
think it should be Olivia’s choice. AITA for refusing to send her back after she
found out her mom lied to her?
