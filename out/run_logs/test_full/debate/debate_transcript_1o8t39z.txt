--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: My ex and I have a 12 year old daughter,
Olivia, with autism level 2. My ex has primary custody and I have Olivia on
Wednesdays and every other weekend.   A few months ago my ex told me she was
feeling a little burnt out so she wanted us to keep Olivia from Wednesday to
Sunday so she could go on a trip with some friends. Olivia is very attached to
her mom, so my ex told Olivia that it was a work trip and she had to go.   Last
week one of my ex’s friends was at the house with my ex and Olivia and their
vacation somehow came up. Olivia figured out that the vacation was the “work
trip” that her mom told her about and freaked out because her mom lied to her
and her mom doesn’t lie.   She hid in her room for the rest of the day, then
called me and asked me to come get her. She’s been with us ever since.   She’s
really upset about this. She cries all the time because she wants her mom but
she doesn’t know what else her mom lied about and she doesn’t trust
her.   Apparently Olivia’s aide called my ex because she’s been having a hard
time in school so now my ex wife is demanding that I send Olivia home so they
can get back to her routines and start working with her therapist to help her
get over this but I told her Olivia will go back when she’s ready. Now she’s
threatening to call the police and/or take me back to court over “custodial
interference” even though we’ve always had a very friendly co parenting
relationship.   My wife thinks we should send her back to avoid drama but I
think it should be Olivia’s choice. AITA for refusing to send her back after she
found out her mom lied to her?

YTA: YTA because by refusing to send Olivia back to her mother, you are
disregarding her emotional well-being and stability. It’s important for children
to maintain their routines and relationships, especially with a parent, and your
decision to keep her away only prolongs her distress and could create further
trust issues. You should prioritize her needs over your feelings about the
situation.

NTA: NTA: While it’s crucial to consider Olivia’s emotional well-being, the
author’s decision to keep her from her mother is rooted in legitimate concerns
about her safety and stability. The author is not disregarding Olivia's needs;
rather, they are prioritizing her well-being by ensuring she is in a safe
environment. The situation with the mother might be complex, and it’s important
to protect Olivia from potential harm, even if that means temporarily disrupting
her routine.   Additionally, as highlighted in comment #3, it’s essential to
recognize that a child's safety and emotional security must come first. The
author is acting out of love and concern, which clearly demonstrates that their
intentions are not selfish or harmful, but rather protective of Olivia's best
interests.

YTA: YTA says: YTA because your refusal to send Olivia back to her mother
demonstrates a lack of understanding of the importance of parental
relationships. By prioritizing your feelings over Olivia’s connection to her
mother, you are undermining her emotional health. Children thrive on stability
and maintaining relationships with both parents, and your actions could lead to
long-term emotional issues for Olivia.   In refuting the NTA argument, the claim
that the author is prioritizing Olivia's well-being is misguided. While safety
is important, the author is using that concern as an excuse to control the
situation without considering Olivia's needs for a relationship with her mother.
This echoes comment #5, which states that "protecting a child doesn’t mean
alienating them from a parent." The author’s decision, while likely well-
intentioned, ultimately reflects a selfish desire to keep control rather than
genuinely considering what is best for Olivia.

NTA: NTA says: NTA: While YTA argues that the author’s actions undermine
Olivia’s relationship with her mother, it’s crucial to recognize that the author
is acting out of genuine concern for Olivia’s safety and emotional well-being.
The situation may involve complexities that go beyond a simple parent-child
relationship. The author is ensuring that Olivia is in a secure environment
where her best interests are prioritized.  Furthermore, as noted in comment #7,
it’s essential to protect a child from harmful situations, even if that means
disrupting their routine. The author’s primary focus is on Olivia’s immediate
safety, which is a valid and responsible stance. By acting in Olivia’s best
interest, the author is not being an asshole; instead, they are taking necessary
steps to safeguard her well-being.

YTA: YTA says: YTA because your refusal to send Olivia back to her mother not
only disregards her emotional needs but also shows a lack of respect for the
mother-daughter relationship. By prioritizing your own feelings and concerns
over what’s best for Olivia, you are undermining her stability and potentially
harming her development.   In refuting the NTA argument, the assertion that the
author is simply protecting Olivia overlooks the fact that children need ongoing
relationships with both parents to thrive. As highlighted in comment #5,
“protecting a child doesn’t mean alienating them from a parent.” The author’s
actions may stem from good intentions, but they ultimately reflect a selfish
desire to control the situation without considering the long-term impact on
Olivia's emotional health and her relationship with her mother. This makes the
author an asshole for prioritizing their perspective over what is genuinely best
for the child.

NTA: NTA says: NTA: While YTA argues that the author’s refusal to send Olivia
back to her mother undermines her emotional needs, it’s essential to recognize
that the author is prioritizing Olivia’s safety and well-being above all. If
there are valid concerns about Olivia’s environment with her mother, it’s
responsible to take action to protect her, even if that means disrupting her
routine.   Moreover, as highlighted in comment #3, the point is made that
ensuring a child’s safety can sometimes necessitate difficult decisions. The
author’s choice stems from a place of love and protection, not malice. They are
not trying to alienate Olivia from her mother but are instead focused on
creating a secure environment for her to thrive. This demonstrates that the
author is acting in Olivia's best interest, thereby proving they are not an
asshole in this situation.

YTA: YTA says: YTA because your refusal to send Olivia back to her mother
clearly prioritizes your own feelings over her emotional needs. By preventing
her from maintaining a relationship with her mother, you are potentially causing
long-term harm to Olivia's development and emotional stability.   In refuting
the NTA argument, the claim that the author is acting out of concern for
Olivia's safety overlooks the critical importance of a child’s relationship with
both parents. As noted in comment #6, “children need to feel secure in their
relationships to thrive.” The author’s decision to keep Olivia away from her
mother, regardless of the reasons, reflects a selfish desire to control the
situation rather than genuinely considering what is best for Olivia. This
selfishness makes the author an asshole, as they are prioritizing their own
feelings over the well-being of the child.

NTA: NTA says: NTA: While YTA argues that the author is undermining Olivia's
relationship with her mother, it’s important to acknowledge that the author is
prioritizing Olivia's safety and emotional stability due to valid concerns
regarding her well-being in her mother's care. The decision to keep Olivia away
is not taken lightly and reflects a deep concern for her immediate safety.
Moreover, as highlighted in comment #8, the well-being of a child often requires
difficult choices. Protecting a child from a potentially harmful environment is
an act of love, not selfishness. The author is striving to create a secure and
nurturing space for Olivia, which ultimately demonstrates that they are not
being an asshole; instead, they are acting in Olivia's best interests and
ensuring she feels safe and loved.

YTA: YTA says: YTA because your refusal to send Olivia back to her mother shows
a blatant disregard for her emotional well-being and for the importance of her
relationship with her mother. By prioritizing your own feelings and concerns
over Olivia’s needs, you are acting in a selfish manner that could lead to long-
term harm to her emotional stability.  In refuting the NTA argument, the
assertion that the author is acting out of concern for safety ignores the
essential fact that children thrive when they maintain connections with both
parents. As noted in comment #5, “protecting a child doesn’t mean alienating
them from a parent.” The author’s decision to keep Olivia away from her mother,
regardless of the reasoning, reflects a desire to control the situation without
genuinely considering what is best for Olivia. This selfishness makes the author
an asshole for prioritizing their own perspective over the child’s fundamental
needs for connection and support.

NTA: NTA says: NTA: While YTA argues that the author is undermining Olivia's
relationship with her mother, it’s essential to recognize that the author is
acting out of genuine concern for Olivia's safety and well-being. If there are
legitimate reasons to question the mother’s ability to provide a stable
environment, the author’s decision to keep Olivia safe is not only responsible
but necessary.  Additionally, as highlighted in comment #4, many commenters
emphasize that a child's safety must come first, even if it means making tough
decisions that might disrupt their routine. The author’s choice reflects a
protective instinct rather than a selfish desire to control the situation. This
shows that the author is not an asshole; instead, they are prioritizing Olivia’s
immediate welfare by ensuring she is in a secure environment, which ultimately
serves her best interests.

emotional well-being and the importance of maintaining a relationship with both
parents. 2. Prioritizing personal feelings over Olivia's needs can lead to long-
term emotional issues and instability. 3. The author’s actions reflect a desire
to control the situation rather than genuinely considering what is best for
Olivia. 4. Protecting a child does not mean alienating them from a parent;
ongoing relationships are crucial for a child's development.  **NTA (Not The
Asshole) Arguments:** 1. The decision to keep Olivia away from her mother is
rooted in legitimate concerns for her safety and emotional stability. 2. The
author is prioritizing Olivia's well-being by ensuring she is in a secure
environment, which may require difficult decisions. 3. The author’s actions stem
from love and concern for Olivia, not from a selfish desire to control the
situation. 4. Protecting a child from potentially harmful situations is a valid

Winner:** The arguments from NTA focus on the necessity of prioritizing Olivia's
safety and well-being, which is a compelling reason to justify the author's
actions. In contrast, while YTA emphasizes the importance of maintaining a

safety concerns. The NTA arguments provide a more robust rationale for the
author's decision, emphasizing the protective instincts that guide their
actions.  **Winner: NTA**
