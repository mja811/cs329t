--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: I’m just curious cause it bothered me. I
liked this one creator. He’s a competitive gamer and he’s really good at this
certain team game. I’m a gamer myself but I don’t consider myself good at this
game. Well I got him in my game I was so excited because wow he’s a pretty big
creator and I’m playing against him. I beat him twice. I went to his discord and
sent him a message along the lines of “ his I saw you in my game ! And I beat
you twice gg!“ and I left a little funny emoji. I didn’t mean any harm I just
thought it was cool that I seen him and I actually won against him. But he just
gave me a rude response like “ well win me 1v1, and the only reason you won is
because I wasn’t playing with my friends, when I said I didn’t mean any harm he
said something like “ well don’t come up in here saying that unless you wanna
beat me 1v1 or something. I want playing with my friends either but still I
thought he was super rude over this game or was I the asshole for my message ?
