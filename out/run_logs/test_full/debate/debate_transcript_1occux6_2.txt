--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: So I'm friends with this guy that I've known
since kindergarten. He got married some years ago and now him and his wife have
a little baby girl and she's currently at toddler age. I come over often enough
that I'm used to seeing the little bugger and she's great. I don't have any
other little kids from family or anything in my life so it's been great seeing a
little human grow.   Every once in a blue moon they ask me to watch her for a
few hours while my friend and his wife get some date time or whatver they need
to do. So I was hanging out with her and I know that they've been trying to get
her to take her first steps. I read about a trick where if you make them hold
something then they will walk without holding onto a surface. So I gave her a
toy and filmed it and it worked!   I sent the video to them and my friend didn't
care, he was just happy but his wife was pissed! She was mad at me that they
weren't there for that big moment. I don't have the type of relationsbio with
her where I can have a deep 1 on 1 with her but I talked to my friend about it
and he's not upset with me but his wife still is. She thinks I robbed her if a
key moment. I did het it on film but I get what she's saying.   I had no
malicious intent but was I the AH for getting the toddler to take those first
steps? I hi estoy didn't think the trick would work but it did.

YTA: YTA - You should have considered the mother's feelings and waited for them
to be present for such an important milestone instead of taking matters into
your own hands.

NTA: I respectfully disagree with the YTA's argument. The author of the post was
in a difficult situation and had to make a quick decision. As mentioned in
example comment #2, sometimes unexpected circumstances arise and it's not always
possible to wait for others to be present. In this case, the author made a
thoughtful decision in the moment to ensure that the milestone was properly
celebrated. The author's actions were not malicious or disrespectful towards the
mother, but rather a way to make the best out of a challenging situation.

YTA: YTA - The author of the post showed a lack of empathy and consideration
towards the mother by excluding her from such an important moment. As mentioned
in example comment #5, it's important to consider the feelings and perspectives
of others, especially when it comes to significant events like a child's first
steps. By making the decision to proceed without the mother present, the author
displayed a selfish attitude and prioritized their own desires over the mother's
potential feelings of exclusion and disappointment. This behavior is not in line
with being a caring and considerate individual, making the author an asshole in
this situation.
