I beat him twice. I went to his discord and sent him a message along the lines of \u201c his I saw you in my game ! And I beat you twice gg!\u201c and I left a little funny emoji. I didn\u2019t mean any harm I just thought it was cool that I seen him and I actually won against him. But he just gave me a rude response like \u201c well win me 1v1, and the only reason you won is because I wasn\u2019t playing with my friends, when I said I didn\u2019t mean any harm he said something like \u201c well don\u2019t come up in here saying that unless you wanna beat me 1v1 or something.

{"selftext": "Hey Reddit this is something that has been on my mind and I feel like I need to share. I(24f) and Tay(23f) have been friends for almost 9 years. I was added to a friend group online by a friend that had her and 4 other people were in. Me and Tay hit it off outside the group and became best friends. I never had any close friends due to being bullied, so having someone I can see as a sister, made my life better. Tay tended to be bossy and when things didn\u2019t go her way, there was a melt down. So to avoid any fights, I went along with her.The group slowly broke off due to a lot of issues but me and her stayed together. Over time I went to go visit her a couple of times and we had a blast everytime.  Then she found this game called phasaphobia. If you don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like you have to go into different maps and find the type of ghost and leave. Well I got into it way more than her and played it when she wasn\u2019t on. I started getting better equipment and leveling up fast. The next time we got on and she saw how much I played, she told me that she wants to only use her level equipment because if she used mine, she considered it cheating. I said it\u2019s fine and it didn\u2019t bother me because I didn\u2019t have that much upgraded anyway.  Over time, I played it more and more and got way better at the game and can see the the higher the equipment, the better it was to find ghosts. I was at least at level 40 and she was still at only level 12. So the next time she decided to play, I told her,\u201dhey I noticed the higher equipment makes things easier, why don\u2019t we use my equipment since I have a lot of money to spend?\u201d. She blew up saying that no it\u2019s cheating and we need to do it with her equipment and that if we don\u2019t then she won\u2019t play.  I told her she\u2019s getting worked up and that it\u2019s not cheating that I wanted to use the higher equipment. She started saying I was disrespecting her boundaries and that I didn\u2019t care how she felt. That resulted into a screaming argument and I told her that she needs to chill it\u2019s just a game and that I\u2019ll talk to her in the morning once she calms down. She yelled saying if I hung up then it\u2019s over and I told her fine and ended the call.  That was over a month ago, AITA?  Edit: I read what you guys said and that there\u2019s a couple things isn\u2019t wanted to say and also I didn\u2019t say what was said in the argument because I didn\u2019t know if Reddit had a limit or if my post would be taken down. I have only bought it up twice, so I always played it how she wanted to play it. The second time I was trying to tell her that the higher equipment was better and I had more money so was trying to help her level up. Also I just wanted her to at least try it once because I wanted to try it my way like how we play it her way. In the argument, i did try to compromise and I asked \u201cok we can use the lower equipment but can I at least use the level two spirit box because it\u2019s always me using it?\u201d. She refused saying that EVERYTHING needs to be level one and that it needs to be her way. I tried asking why couldn\u2019t I use just one thing and she wouldn\u2019t listen. This isn\u2019t the first time we fought like this but that\u2019s different stories", "post_id": "1od04cq", "title": "AITA For getting mad at a game?", "flair": "Asshole", "created_utc": 1761112047, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1od04cq/aita_for_getting_mad_at_a_game/", "downs": 0, "ups": 0, "score": 0}
{"selftext": "I (22F) am best friends with 22M. We\u2019ve been friends since around 2017 when the Nintendo switch came out. It bonded us during school and we\u2019ve been friends ever since.   We\u2019ve gone through a lot of changes, from school to university, to jobs to partners to friends.   Cut to now and I\u2019m kind of pissed off at him. Since being at uni he\u2019s never been the best replier and he also has a partner, friends, activities. But I feel like whenever I text him, I\u2019m always the first to do so, he doesn\u2019t send nor look at anything I send on socials (we used to be avid reels senders). We do movie nights to catch up as we don\u2019t live close to each other, and we haven\u2019t had one in ages. I messaged about doing one and he was like \u2018maybe this day\u2019 and I messaged about a few times and he\u2019d made other plans.   Maybe I\u2019m just hormonal and missing my best friend. And like I get he\u2019s busy but considering I\u2019m the best friend, I feel like I\u2019m not even probably thought about that much. The most active he\u2019s been was when I got a girlfriend and then since that\u2019s been the new normal he\u2019s dropped off again. (I can confirm that it wouldn\u2019t be because of that, as again we both have partners and gayness).  Am I being the asshole for being a bit mad about this - does anyone have any advice.  Part of me is thinking not to reach out until he messages me now but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just being bitter. Or in general if I\u2019m being too clingy here when some people barely speak to their best friend that much.

{"selftext": "First time posting on Reddit cause all my friends are asleep. I roommate (M19) am a college and like many have a roommate. We were randomly assigned and I got a reasonable roommate (F19). She was seeing this guy (M20) and I was fine with him spending the night sometimes. He seemed fine to be so I didn\u2019t really care. Over the past few weeks he has been getting really upset/angry at something (usually something me or my roommate said) with not communication of why, being overall unhygienic, and overly blunt to the point of coming off as a bit rude. I\u2019ve been trying to let it slide since I\u2019m typically not one for confrontation but it\u2019s gotten to the point where sleepovers are a nightmare. Not to get to deep but I am a very traumatized person, so if I do not feel safe around someone sleeping/going to sleep I cannot sleep. I do not feel 100% safe around him and because of this it has made any time he spends the night my own personal hell, this lack of sleep on top of my pre-existing chronic illness has caused me to feel sick. But I don\u2019t want him to feel like he\u2019s not welcome/hurt my roommates feelings as he\u2019s over what feels like a reasonable amount. But I don\u2019t want this to mess with college.

{"selftext": "During the school season, I was in a soccer club team with all of my best friends. We've been on this team since last year, with the same coaches and teammates. Throughout the season, our one coach Rebecca has been kind of off from the start with me specifically. Flashback to a year ago, I tried out for a higher club division in the summer and I ended up not making it despite having similar athleticism, skill, and positivity as others who made it - Rebecca was coaching that team that year. It obviously was devastating since soccer means a lot to me and I really wanted to make that team but this didn't mean I was putting others who made it down or talking negatively in any sort about the people involved in the situation.   So when this year's season started, I already had let go of the summer and what had happened, and was playing with a good mindset and positivity. I was cheering others on the best I could, being polite to all coaches including Rebecca, and pushing myself at every practice and tournament. However, I could already sense Rebecca didn't really like me as much as the other people on my team or that something was off but I didn't understand why because I've never done anything to her that past year (turns out I was right). My coach also tends to be on the harsher side and visibly had favourites last year and they aren't on the team this year. Another issue we had this season was the fact that there was a mix-up about who captains were. Long-story short, it was originally me, and my other friend but it got switched arbitrarily to other people, as coaches don't really care about who captains are as long as there are three. That also caused a bit of drama which will be relevant later on.   One tournament day, all four of us \"captains\" were going to go talk to the other team's captains but Rebecca gave a bit of a dismissive opinion that only two of us should go. I understand more than two captains is a bit absurd, but I felt like I couldn't have a say in who should go and what. After the game, I went to my friends and shared how I felt about how Rebecca worded things and how it felt a bit harsh and unnecessary. I wasn't aware that Rebecca overheard our conversation and next practice it became a rule that no captains were allowed anymore. I talked to the coaches about it and their reasoning made sense but I felt that there was no value in doing that because it just made team tension worse. One other coach fully understood how me and my friends felt, and agreed that it might have been overboard. AITA for how things turned out? AITA for just stating my opinion on something with my close friends?", "post_id": "1odr3g1", "title": "AITA for talking behind my coach's back while she was near?", "flair": "Not the A-hole", "created_utc": 1761184690, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1odr3g1/aita_for_talking_behind_my_coachs_back_while_she/", "downs": 0, "ups": 0, "score": 0}
