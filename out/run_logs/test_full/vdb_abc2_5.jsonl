{"selftext": "I(20F) have a friend (20F) whose birthday is coming up in 2 weeks. We live in a Dorm with strict rules(in-time and stuff), and she decided that she wants to stay out for her birthday+weekend, her birthday falls on a Friday so she is planning a full 3 day thing in the city. There are a few problems with it.  First one is that my parents are definitely not okay with this, she is asking me to lie to my parents about it and go along with her plan. Her point is I have gone out multiple times by lying to my parents, which is true but I have never stayed out all night, all of them were day things.   Evey time I try to bring up the fact that I am uncomfortable with the plan or I won't be able to join, she starts complaining that everything is wrong in her life and her birthday is also going to be ruined.   While we have other friends who are in on the plan, she will cancel her plans if I am not going, but I do not wish to lie to my parents about this. I am in a far away city for my uni, where they do not have people they know. They have entrusted me with my own safety and they trust that i follow the rules they have set for me. I do not wish to break that to such an extreme degree.  Second is, the plan is expensive, she is paying for some portion of it but I have to manage the rest myself. Her parents are giving her extra birthday cash, mine won't be giving me money for her birthday. My spending this year has already been quite high so I barely have much left and there is still more than a month before I can go home for Christmas break.  Third thing being her plan is to crash at a friends place, who is completely fine if not overjoyed by the idea. I am not fond of that person, it's not that i have a dislike to her it's just that i find that person extremely annoying. The point is she does too. She talks bad about her, makes fun of her, laughs when other people say something bad about her, but also invites her many times to hangout with us and stuff.   Recently the same thing happened and I feel bad for the girl as she always agrees to whatever because she doesn't have many people she could consider friends.  I do not know how to approach this anymore. The only way left is to tell her straight that i cannot join her in her plans even though it would mean she will have to cancel everything.   While I am sure my reasoning is good I know this will completely ruin her birthday. She has had a lot of problems she is facing recently so she will feel horrible about it.   I just need an opinion whether it is reasonable for me to go through with it or would I be the asshole if I did.  **TLDR**: My friend wants to have a 3 day celebration for her birthday as she is feeling down these days but due to my parents, money and people in the plan I do not wish to. But if I do not go it would mean she cancels the plan, WIBTA if I am the reason she doesn't celebrate her birthday.  **Additional Info I was told to add:**   My dorm will need permission from my parents if I am going out.    I come from a country where traditionally women were married off young and not sent out of homes for education.   So most dorm or such places are 'responsible' for the safety of the students staying there, so to make sure that if something happens to the student they aren't held solely responsible, they confirm with the parents that they know about the plan or whatever.  It is much lenient for guys, but for us we have strict rules we need to adhere to.", "post_id": "1octsoi", "title": "WIBTA if I tell a friend tat I have too many problems with her birthday plan?", "flair": "Everyone Sucks", "created_utc": 1761092767, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1octsoi/wibta_if_i_tell_a_friend_tat_i_have_too_many/", "downs": 0, "ups": 0, "score": 0}
{"selftext": "Posting this before I go to bed maybe regret it tomorrow morning anyway, for some context: I live in an Asian household and like the stereotypes my mom has always been a straight-A student and top of her school, my older sibling has always been praised for being super smart from a young age. Me? I struggle with school. I wasn't always like this, and my grades aren't bad, they're just not all As.   I've switched to online classes and so my mom said that I shouldn't have bad grades or missing work etc. I've been doing good so far, I've had some missing assignments here and there but end up turning them in late (but no late penalty) and my assignments are always in the range of 85%-100% but for some classes even with those percentages the total grade is like a D or C (It's a whole thing) I told my mom about it when she asked about my grades, she agreed it was strange.  One night after I when out with my friends she yelled at me for not turning in all of my assignments and etc same conversation from before. She kept switching what she was mad about every time I tried to explain myself. She told me no going out unless I turn in all of my assignments. I did all of my work and then I thought that was the end of it.  Since then, she would constantly ask about my grades. It gets on my nerves. She's been asking about literally nothing but school work, so obviously whenever she mentions school again I get a little agitated, but I don't want to get in trouble I don't say anything. When I get agitated I close my door a little too hard, or I walk a little too loud, and etc. So she would say \"why are you so mad?\" and \"I guess I won't tell you to do anything\" (Not exact words but I can't exactly translate it)  Today was when things sort of \"blew up\". Not sure how it even started but basically, my family (mom, dad, sibling) sat me down and said I need a better schedule/routine and etc. They told me things as if I could follow routines best fit for them, and maybe I could but it wouldn't be best for *me*. Later my mom and dad were talking and asked me why I was \"throwing a fit\" (not sure what they word they used is in English but that's close to it) and I said that I'm allowed to have emotions. Later my mom came into my room and asked why I'm mad at her, then I blew up. I told her, while sobbing, that I'm tired of her always talking about school and that I'm really trying my hardest, and that I can't take it whenever she talks about school. I told her that she hasn't talked to me about anything but school. She completely missed the point, she kept telling me that she has to so that my grades would be better. I honestly don't know what she was talking about because I was so shocked at her response. She ended the conversation with \"I'm too scared to even talk to you\" (another rough translation). Me and mom are super close, the post may not seem like it but it's true, I love her more than anyone. That's why I don't know what to do, so am I the asshole?", "post_id": "1ocyr6h", "title": "AITA for \"throwing a fit\" after my mom got mad at me?", "flair": "Not the A-hole", "created_utc": 1761107281, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ocyr6h/aita_for_throwing_a_fit_after_my_mom_got_mad_at_me/", "downs": 0, "ups": 2, "score": 2}
{"selftext": "For context, I (17F) and my friend (16F) have been friends since we were 4 and 5. Things didn't really change until last year. My old best friend \\[Ill call her Alice\\] and I became super close about two years ago. we bonded over a toxic person who hurt us both in the same way. But everything shifted when I got a boyfriend. I've never been boy-crazy; I just happened to get into a relationship first, and she blew up over it. After that, Alice changed a lot and started to obsessively try and change to find a boyfriend. When my boyfriend and I eventually broke up, she completely dropped me and started calling me toxic, weird, fat, ugly, etc.   Now onto the friend I'm currently having issues with \\[I'll call her Natasha.\\] She has really attached herself to Alice. Natasha has had a rough family life and is usually staying at someone's house. I want to make it clear that I don't care that Natasha and Alice are friends. I was bummed at first because we all used to be close, but ive accepted that part. The problem now is that i've been feeling very lonely because Natasha is always with Alice.   This week I had a church conference Thursday and Friday, and that was what finally broke me. Natasha and Alice spent most of the time whispering to each other and going in and out of the bathroom crying because the guy Natasha is talking to his ex showed up and she had an issue with Natasha. Meanwhile I just sat there and watched, waiting to be including in the conversation. Newsflash that never happened. On the last day, I ended up having a breakdown because I felt useless and unwanted. It feels like the only time Natasha talks to me is when something is going wrong for her.   I don't need constant attention; I just want *some* effort in return. I also know i've been petty or rude at moments out of hurt, but whenever i try to talk to her she either walks away or talks over me changing the topic. Without Natasha I have no friends, and im scared of losing her too.   Now I don't know what to do. I just feel stupid and like i'm a bad friend, even though i've looked over the situation a hundred times and can't figure out what I actually am doing that is wrong besides trying to communicate my feelings.

{"selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years, and our relationship has been a little rocky in the past few months. Because of this, I\u2019ve been staying with my mom on and off. I moved in with him about a year ago.  During this time, I\u2019ve realized that his family has a lot of drama. He recently started talking with his sister after being on rocky terms for years. She was in an abusive relationship for seven years, and he didn\u2019t talk to her for two of those years.  One day, she told him she felt like she didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to. I offered to be there for her, because I\u2019ve been in abusive relationships myself and wanted her to know she\u2019s not alone. He gave her my number, and I ended up having a phone conversation with her.  After that, she started calling me every other day to talk about her trauma and her abusive relationship. I suggested she get a therapist or an attorney for legal advice regarding her living situation, but she said she didn\u2019t have the money. Later, she told me she had another boyfriend and had been traveling with him, but she was still technically living with her abusive ex. She also asked me to keep it a secret from my boyfriend.  I felt really uncomfortable being caught in the middle of all of this. When I tried to express my unease about the situation to my boyfriend, he said, \u201cWell, don\u2019t you have any empathy for people being abused since you\u2019ve been abused yourself?\u201d When I told him I was overwhelmed and thought she needed professional help, he also said that maybe I shouldn\u2019t have contacted her in the first place.  A couple months ago, he told me he was going home for Thanksgiving, and that his sister would be moving in with us. I was taken aback, but since it\u2019s his house, I didn\u2019t push too hard. While staying at my mom\u2019s, I reflected on the situation and started feeling uneasy and upset.  I asked him if she had a plan for how long she would stay or if he wanted to set any boundaries, and he said he didn\u2019t know. When I asked if she might stay longer than a year, he said \u201cmaybe.\u201d I feel that if our relationship were stronger, I probably wouldn\u2019t be as upset, but given the circumstances and his rocky history with his sister, I\u2019m skeptical and uncomfortable with this situation.

{"selftext": "VERY long story short...I am in undergrad right now and left home a few months ago after a particularly bad fight with my mother. For context, I only live there during the summers when I'm home from school. Her and I have always gotten along, but she has always been very volatile and has been abusive at times and that has caused strain on the relationship. This summer was a bit of a breaking point, and I left home before I was supposed to because she got so angry she insisted she didn't want to live with me anymore. I have since stopped most contact with her and she is very upset. This past weekend, she demanded I give her back the my 529 (for those who don't know, this is a special savings account you can use to pay for educational expenses). My dilemma is that I am completely on my own financially and literally cannot live without this money...I live off campus and cannot afford food or tuition or rent without the 529. She insists I should take out loans like she did and that I am acting entitled for refusing to give her the money back.
