    "NTA: it would have been nice if you called but it slipped your mind. She is also capable of texting you to let you know she wants something.  The cussing is a complete over reaction by your wife.",
    "NTA.   1) Raging and swearing isn't ok in your home. I'd let her cool off then tell her that you need to talk. Insist on couples counseling for the sake of your kids- you don't want them growing up thinking that this is how they should let other people treat them.  2) Prolonged trouble sleeping and irritability can be a sign of depression. The counselor should be able to get her screened, but her primary care doc can as well.  3) If she refuses to go to therapy, get an individual therapsit yourself to help you do a health check on your marriage. If you're in a bad situation you need to consider getting out for the sake of your kids.

    "NTA. You were busy and forgot to call. Considering every other time she\u2019s not wanted anything, it shouldn\u2019t be such a huge issue. And I\u2019ll bet she only wanted a sandwich because you DIDN\u2019T call. If you had, the answer would have been no. There is zero reason for her to flip out and swear at you like that. You took a mental load item off her plate and let her rest. Is this how she behaves every time you try to help?",
    "NTA but does your wife normally go off like this about small nothings? Cause let's face it, we pretty much ALL agree this was a harmless accident and she is out of line. BUT... why did she flip her lid? Why did she overreact over something so trivial? This is the question, maybe ask/think back... is there was an underlying issue and this just tipped the scale? Even something as stupid as a bad dream about you. Did you not load the dishwasher last night?   Just feels like this is about more than a text and sandwich.",
    "Why didn't she just text you? She knew what was going on, so why not take the initiative and text you? She sounds rather unhinged to cuss someone out because she didn't get a sandwich. Is she always this much of a bully?",
    "She is way overreacting",
    "NTA. Let her cool down for a few days, and sit down for a heart to heart. You two should work on identifying the reasons for her sleep issues and emotional imbalance. Let her know how much you love her and don\u2019t want her to be silently suffering. How addressing and treating will be incredibly positive for the emotional wellbeing of the kids. See where that goes, and hopefully much good will come from this."

    "NTA. And NO you are not wrong to any extent. Its perfectly ak to STOP offering is someone ALWAYS says no. No, there is something else going on. Is she maybe interested in someone else and is resenting her marriage. That seems way more plausible. Time to investigate. That is if you even want to know."

  "selftext": "So today I took my kids to get their shots, offered because alot of times my wife struggles to sleep. So she can sleepin a bit . This gives her time to get ready and once im done I meet her and she gets one of the kids and take to school and I take the other (divide and conquer). In the past I usually go to the cafeteria (Army hospital) after the shots to get food for lunch for myself and whatever the kids want. I usually call my wife to ask if she wants anything and every time she says no. Today I failed to call to ask and she goes off on me as to why I didnt call her to ask and that she would have wanted a sandwich. Now shes telling me cusing me out and dropping f bombs. I did apologize and admitted I failed to call her and she continued and to not call her for the rest of the day. Naturally I got upset too because here im focusing on trying to take care of the kids, I even offered to take one of the kids to school because she was going to take both (we both work and i was late in). I know im wrong to some extent but is she overreacting? Am I the asshole?",
