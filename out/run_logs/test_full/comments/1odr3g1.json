    "NTA. Welcome to life. Some people will take a dislike to you for no apparent reason and take advantage of any opportunity to knock you down a peg. So it goes. It's their bad, not yours. You did yourself no favors by badmouthing Rebecca so publicly, but I hope you've learnt a lesson there."

    "I think not the asshole, I feel like some context clues are missing. Communication between you and Rebecca would be great so you could figure out why she is being more dismissive towards you, but if you are just vocalizing abt how you are feeling in the moment, that's perfectly fine. She already seemed to have a problem with you before she had overheard the conversation, anyway."

  "selftext": "During the school season, I was in a soccer club team with all of my best friends. We've been on this team since last year, with the same coaches and teammates. Throughout the season, our one coach Rebecca has been kind of off from the start with me specifically. Flashback to a year ago, I tried out for a higher club division in the summer and I ended up not making it despite having similar athleticism, skill, and positivity as others who made it - Rebecca was coaching that team that year. It obviously was devastating since soccer means a lot to me and I really wanted to make that team but this didn't mean I was putting others who made it down or talking negatively in any sort about the people involved in the situation.   So when this year's season started, I already had let go of the summer and what had happened, and was playing with a good mindset and positivity. I was cheering others on the best I could, being polite to all coaches including Rebecca, and pushing myself at every practice and tournament. However, I could already sense Rebecca didn't really like me as much as the other people on my team or that something was off but I didn't understand why because I've never done anything to her that past year (turns out I was right). My coach also tends to be on the harsher side and visibly had favourites last year and they aren't on the team this year. Another issue we had this season was the fact that there was a mix-up about who captains were. Long-story short, it was originally me, and my other friend but it got switched arbitrarily to other people, as coaches don't really care about who captains are as long as there are three. That also caused a bit of drama which will be relevant later on.   One tournament day, all four of us \"captains\" were going to go talk to the other team's captains but Rebecca gave a bit of a dismissive opinion that only two of us should go. I understand more than two captains is a bit absurd, but I felt like I couldn't have a say in who should go and what. After the game, I went to my friends and shared how I felt about how Rebecca worded things and how it felt a bit harsh and unnecessary. I wasn't aware that Rebecca overheard our conversation and next practice it became a rule that no captains were allowed anymore. I talked to the coaches about it and their reasoning made sense but I felt that there was no value in doing that because it just made team tension worse. One other coach fully understood how me and my friends felt, and agreed that it might have been overboard. AITA for how things turned out? AITA for just stating my opinion on something with my close friends?",
