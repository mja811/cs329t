    "YTA.  You should have added her as your agent when you signed the contract as she turned you on to the builder.  Also, it would have existed you nothing.  Sellers pay the commission and you would have an agent representing your interests."

    "Back to court. Instant adherence to all conditions in the custody agreement to the letter. All communication through a court approved parenting app. No communication with any of his family during your custody time if not mandated by the court. Document all attempts at parental alienation, injuries, broken or missing items sent with the kid.   If they want to play dirty make mud!!!",
    "NTA but you do realise they've won this \"battle\". You shouldn't have backed out. Stop living your life to the tune of your ex in laws. Give them that battle but make sure you win the \"war\" by living your life how you want to.",
    "NTA,  Stop letting them into your life!  No working with them, and NO more not sticking to the Child Visitation agreement.   Plan everything on your time, and keep to the agreement. Stop trying to be nice. They are not nice, they are jerks that want to control you.",
    "Jesus Christ. Grow a pair of balls and stop rolling over for these people.   First, time to get a formal custody agreement through the court and follow it. Period. No exceptions. Keep ALL communications strictly between you and your ex, and only use a parenting app approved through the courts. Block all other family memebers. Your son can see that side on his dads time.   Second, file a restraining order for harassment against your ex MIL. The builder even told you what she was doing is unethical. Why would you give in to the drama? Why would you let that cost YOUR SON A FOREVER HOME?!? Seriously?   Apologize to your son for being weak. Then call the builder, buy the home, and be the strong parent that does the right thing even when it\u2019s hard. Your son is watching. What are you teaching him by letting them bully you and you backing down? Do better. For yourself and for him",
    "NTA. try and get that house back and call whoever it is you call about your decree or whatever being violated. If theyre going to go all in like that, you have to show that you're willing to do it too. Otherwise they'll walk all over you. My only concern here is your kid. And what they'll say about you to them. Whether they'll try and keep them from you again.   Best of luck and lawyers to you!",
    "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry they stole this opportunity from you. Lawyer up and file an ethics complaint to your state\u2019s licensing agency.",
    "Why would you back out of the home? If he's withholding you kid during your court mandated parenting time, go to the cops. Otherwise go back to your family law lawyer and do things that way. Either way don't ever let her get involved in the purchase of your home.",
    "They have been too much in your life,  in ways that you thought were just being cooperative, but it was never about cooperation.  it was about manipulation and being able to know all your business that they don't actually have a right to know.   Not that they will ever admit to this, they will only ever believe they were being helpful, and that YOU are the one who behaved badly and threw it in their faces.  You are in a dangerous spot now, the most dangerous time is when they think you are leaving them.  Despite the divorce being that far in the past, it is only know, when he knows you are in another relationship, that he actually FEELS that you are truly gone.  Check up on your home security, remind your family and coworkers and the parents of your Childs friends/adult leaders of activities,  that since you are divorced, they should not speak to him about you, your habits, your plans.  Reduce contact and interactions for dealing with the kid to only those described in the divorce decree. communicate with the app so everything is documented.  Consider changing. your phone number. Consider moving and having your child exchange in a public place rather than your doorstep or his.  Get a ring doorbell if not a more elaborate camera system.  Protect yourself.  NTA.",
    "I came to support the advice given.   You need your lawyer to notify the court about the family harassing you and not following custody agreement.  You should send screen shots and any other supporting evidence to state real estate licensing board. Ask the builder if he'll write up a short statement of his experience with your MIL. What she did was illegal and unethical.  Consider going to small claims court to get reimbursed for expenses incurred for a vaction you had to forego thanks to the ex withholding your child.  They will stop messing with you if you make it too painful. I'd send them a copy of the divorce decree with a note telling them it's none of their business if you're dating or not. You're a free woman. It sounds like you unloaded hundreds of pounds of dead weight you were dragging around.",
    "YTA for going back on your agreement with builder.  You realize now they are going to control your life right? Also your very excited son is probably disappointed.",
    "NTA but you should not have given in to your ex's family, you should have kept the house.  But since you have and since they have made it clear that they do not wish you well, start using the decree to make your life easier and don't hesitate to collect proof of their use of manipulation, etc. when they refuse to let you live your life as you see fit.",
    "That\u2019s disgusting. In making your life harder, they are robbing their son and grandchild. I hope they are proud of themselves.",
    "You need to communicate through a family app so all this abuse is documented.",
    "Divorce is hard and so hard to navigate, I feel for you.   I can\u2019t say YTA here because you didn\u2019t do anything explicitly wrong, but if you had ANY realtor show you a home/introduce you to a builder it is general courtesy to re involve them when you\u2019re ready to move forward if you weren\u2019t ready at that time.   You aren\u2019t in the wrong, but I can also understand why MIL is upset with you.   Now that being said what they are doing to you, withholding your child isn\u2019t right and I agree with others, you need to get legal agreements in place and they need to be followed if they are going to start game playing.",

    "NTA for not getting her involved.   However, \u201cbegging the builder to put her on\u201d no ma\u2019am!   Ex is withholding your child from you? No ma\u2019am! If you have a custody plan on paper and he\u2019s refusing to follow it- call your lawyer and the police.   Don\u2019t let his family dictate your life! Find a better village to help when \u201csomething comes up\u201d.",
    "You\u2019re letting yourself feel bad. You\u2019re letting them have an impact on you.   Okay, you missed out on a holiday because it wasn\u2019t in line with your divorce custody arrangement. Now you know better, wont happen again.   Emotional turmoil? Seriously? You let them ruin your homeowner moment, no one else. You\u2019re divorced. You\u2019re single. You\u2019re dating. It\u2019s your life, you\u2019re in the drivers seat, start acting like it.   I won\u2019t call you an AH, but come on. Step up.   If you want the house, buy the house.",
    "Go back to court, get an established parenting agreement in place, communicate through a coparenting app only and he can maintain relationship between your child and his family on his time.",
    "NTA but take his ass to court and get custody of your son, he has no right to hold him over your head for something that you are trying to do to have him in a permanent home.",
    "You caved to the pressure and let them win. They are now emboldened and know they can get you to knuckle under. It is all worse now as a result. You need the power of the court to start enforcing orders. It's time to file contempt motions and such.  ...and stop caving.",
    "NTA. Obey the court agreement. They get absolutely zero say in how you live your life as long as you follow the court ordered agreement. MIL does not get to pump you for money. That is all this is about, she's greedy. So greedy she tried to get a businessman to commit fraud on her behalf.  As for the dating thing, your ex has no say over your personal life. That is what being an ex means - they lost all input into your decisions unless they specifically involve the child and that is covered by the court agreement.  They are all toxic and manipulative.",
    "NTA Your former MIL had no business sticking her nose into that sale.  I would have stuck with the house because they are going to do this to you over any home you purchase.  They don\u2019t want you to be happy, they want you to always be miserable.    I would ignore what they say or take your ex back to court to raise the child support your ex pays.  Don\u2019t keep giving them power over you.  From now on stick to the court approved agreement.  They want to give you grief, then you will make them follow the court agreement.  Also go back to court and establish your only contact with them will be through a co-parenting app.",
    "Hell NO!!  SHE is overstepping her bounds and IF she was so bent on a commission she should have handled it as a contracted realtor and signed the contract back then.  Another issue you could raise is how she is treating you on the personal level and ask her how it would effect her position IF you filled a complaint for her attitude/treatment of you.  There is a reason you don't do business with family.",

    "NTA    However, Grow a spine and stand up for yourself. You backed out of a legitimate deal and a wonderful opportunity because your ex MIL threw an illegal hissy fit...       Not to mention just listen to the decree from now on. Do vacations and such on your time and don't trust your miserable excuse for an ex husband on anything...",
    "NTA.  I would also contact whomever licenses real estate agents and her brokerage to notify them of her unethical conduct.",
    "Oh no, the moment you backed down was the moment they won. You will not be allowed to date in peace, do anything in peace. Your ex-MIL is not your friend, do not treat her as such, do not pander to her nonsense.  There is no peace to be kept with such people, all there is is manipulation.    Get back to court and get those rules with child care and custody sorted and battened down like a ship during a hurricane.   Start again, get your home and keep the ex family out of your personal life.",
    "Holy cow.  Your ex-mother-in-law (whom, frankly, you shouldn't be having anything to do with) tried to steal 4% out of your pocket, harassed you endlessly about it, sabotaged your home deal, and you're feeling guilty?    You need to cut your ex and his family out of your life.  They're nothing but sources of chaos.",
    "Hear me out. As a formerly physically and verbally abused spouse.  The best thing you can do is LIVE your life. The people who are not on the side of good and loving prosperous things for you and your child will only shrink when you cast your light.  They are manipulating you through the child. It took me years to figure out my child's dad only wanted to me make me miserable, not love the child. You have to not let on that it kills you if they exercise their parenting time. Don't ask or expect favors. Don't give them. By doing this you will create room for the people who will LOVE you and the child. They knew it would hurt you to not see your family. You should GO! Do not ever let them see you weak. Your child will know who truly loves you.  Go find another cute house. Do not tell your son until it closes with the bank to protect him from accidentally saying something. You've got this."

  "selftext": "AITA? Needing some opinions if I am in the wrong here. I have been divorced 3 years this November. My ex mother in law and I don\u2019t really have a close relationship but we are always civil and I make sure my son stays very involved with her as a grandmother. My ex mother in law is a Realtor and I looked at homes with her in April but decided to wait and keep saving. Since then, I have been having issues with my ex husband (I started dating again in may and he\u2019s livid) and so it has resulted in distancing myself from his family over the past 6 months due to their very vocal opinions of me dating again after 3 years of being single.  I started looking at home again for various agents and last week I reconnected with the builder (she introduced me to in April) and signed a contract on a home he\u2019s building . My son was very involved in this and out of excitement let his dad know we are buying a house. Long story short, my ex mother in law found out and called the builder behind my back demanding to be added to the contract to get a commission (went on for 48 hours before I found out) The builder obviously could not do this because one, she was not physical there when the home was shown and she is not representing me. We never signed a buyer/rep agreement. She tried emailing one that was back dated but I refused to sign one, to me that is unethical and dishonest. I was very thankful she took the time back in April to show me 2 homes but we were in such a different place in our relationship and I also want to add she repeatedly told me she was going to waive her commission and put it toward closing costs. She harassed me for days over this and my ex husband withheld my child from me and we missed a paid for vacation last week to visit family (we have a decree but have never followed it) so since it was technically his time I lost out on the whole trip. I have been told they will no longer help me when needed etc etc. After not being to see or speak to my child for days, I called the builder and begged him to add her because of the drama it was causing which he declined to do so on ethics. As of today I backed out of the home, it was a week of emotional turmoil which I thought buying my first home as a single mother would be a happy time. It is. Is being spun by my exes entire family I did her wrong and karma will be paid back. AITA for not getting her back involved?",
