    "NTA, you\u2019re not clingy for missing your friend. It\u2019s fair to feel hurt when you\u2019re the only one putting in effort. Give him space and see if he reaches out, that\u2019ll show if he still values the friendship",
    "NTA what you feel is valid but with time relationships and priorities change. Try to expand your other friendships bc it kinda sounds like you\u2019re really dependent on him. I know it sucks but life moves on. Move on with it as well and don\u2019t get stuck &lt;3",
    "NTA - sometimes relationships change, especially when seperated by physical distance. I say continue to be friends with him as much as you like but make sure you're taking the chance to meet all the new people in your life too!",
    "NTA. People grow apart sometimes. Their priorities change. They might change. Life happens.   You're not the AH for being upset about it, he is your best friend and it's natural to feel hurt or upset when someone you love and care for deeply becomes distant or is not as close as you once were.  He isn't an AH either. Life happens, priorities change, people grow apart. Friendships end sometimes. It's important to understand that it is not a reflection on you."

    "Sometimes friendships end.   NAH. People grow apart. Priorities change. There's a very high likelihood your best friend when you were 14 is not going to be your best friend in adult life.",
    "NAH  I am 52, and I have ONE best friend I have been friends with since I was 3 years old. Otherwise, some people who I was best friends with in HS, I no longer talk to. Some people I recently met and am good friends with, those friendships are very new.   Friends are like ships in the night. Sometimes you pass each other by, and when you do, you pick up where you left off. Others you set a different course and when you do see them so much has changed. But, that's the ebb and flow of friendships. They come and go. You are this friend might be growing apart. Sexuality isn't a common bond between the sexes. (You both attracted to same sex people....at least that's how I read it. It sounds like you both are gay??) Even if you both are, there is still a difference in lives as you get old. Hell, this is why some married people don't last. They grow apart.   I would just say, you don't need to constantly reach out, but every once in a while, just send him something cute and then let it go. If he still doesn't answer, then you can probably chalk that friendship up to being one that has ran its course.",
    "I can't call you an AH for missing your friend but try to keep in mind people grow and change. You said he's got a girlfriend, and also that the most active he's been in your friendship was when you had a partner aswell. Do you know his partner? Is it a female that might be jealous even though you're not into guys? Or maybe the timing was just a coincidence. Either way I'd back off. If he's not willing to pin something down or make time to hang out he might have moved on and just didn't say anything to you about it.",
    "NAH, if you're going to different schools it can be tough.  I stayed friends with my bff from home when I went to college but I was never in a romantic relationship in college, if I had been it would have been tougher to make time for my bff from home I'm sure.",
    "\"I\u2019m the best friend\" your not, plain and simple, people grow, change, grow apart, its possible you see him as your best friend, but he doesnt see you as his best friend. NAH.",
    "NAH.   This is a really tough but common situation for people our age. I have a few close friends from high school left, people I'd consider my original 'best' friends- and although I deeply love and care for them, unfortunately none of us have the bandwidth to be in touch super regularly. Outside of work, uni, chores, hobbies, it's hard enough for us to balance seeing our partners and local friends enough as it is- let alone long distance best friends. This has meant we get a very small 'slice of the pie' of each others time. It doesn't mean we don't care about each other, it's just so hard to keep up with each other's lives now. Luckily we're all on the same page, so it's bittersweet, but not painful. I think what really helps is carving out proper quality time together once or twice a year, by visiting each other for a weekend or something, or getting an airbnb. Then it feels like back to old times.   Maybe be honest about how you feel you've drifted, without assigning blame."

  "selftext": "I (22F) am best friends with 22M. We\u2019ve been friends since around 2017 when the Nintendo switch came out. It bonded us during school and we\u2019ve been friends ever since.   We\u2019ve gone through a lot of changes, from school to university, to jobs to partners to friends.   Cut to now and I\u2019m kind of pissed off at him. Since being at uni he\u2019s never been the best replier and he also has a partner, friends, activities. But I feel like whenever I text him, I\u2019m always the first to do so, he doesn\u2019t send nor look at anything I send on socials (we used to be avid reels senders). We do movie nights to catch up as we don\u2019t live close to each other, and we haven\u2019t had one in ages. I messaged about doing one and he was like \u2018maybe this day\u2019 and I messaged about a few times and he\u2019d made other plans.   Maybe I\u2019m just hormonal and missing my best friend. And like I get he\u2019s busy but considering I\u2019m the best friend, I feel like I\u2019m not even probably thought about that much. The most active he\u2019s been was when I got a girlfriend and then since that\u2019s been the new normal he\u2019s dropped off again. (I can confirm that it wouldn\u2019t be because of that, as again we both have partners and gayness).  Am I being the asshole for being a bit mad about this - does anyone have any advice.  Part of me is thinking not to reach out until he messages me now but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just being bitter. Or in general if I\u2019m being too clingy here when some people barely speak to their best friend that much. Plus I know friendships with men are super different to women.",
