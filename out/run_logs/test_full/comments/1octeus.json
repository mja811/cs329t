    "NTA. I think your feelings are totally valid. She blew you off on an important day, and was selfishly worried about herself. That being said, she is/was 17 and I made terrible decisions at that age. If my friends hadn\u2019t shown me grace after breaking up with my first boyfriend (after similarly canceling/sneaking around/ leaving hangouts early) I wouldn\u2019t have my best friend 10 years later.  All this to say- I think you should have a conversation about how she hurt your feelings and how you two can work past this (if that is what you choose). Nobody is perfect, but you have every right to draw your own boundaries as you see fit.",
    "NTA. I totally understand you\u2019re feelings and you have a right to be upset and disappointed! I\u2019d let her know how she made you feel for sure, but I wouldn\u2019t end the friendship over it. It can be tough when friends get in relationships"

  "selftext": "One of my best friends I\u2019ve known since grade 8 got with a boy in the beginning of June and didn\u2019t tell any of us in the friend group  We are a very close knit friend group. She kept dismissing our hangouts and ghosting us during them, despite her planning most of them just to hang out with him.   Due to a strict family, she is not allowed to see him or any relationships. At my 18th birthday party, she forgot about a gift, the whole party and she showed up late and then left early to go see him after giving me a very rude card and 50 bucks in the card. (For reference, I had bought her a pandora bracelet with matching charms for her 17th.) Mind you she did not tell us about him and my grandpa had died from cancer two days prior.  During my party after she left, she called me and begged me to lie to her older sister, who was in my driveway about her whereabouts for her. She still hadn\u2019t told me where she was (which was with him) and repeatedly refused to do so. I didn\u2019t get to talk to her sister because the boy dropped her off before that.  Now, after a long summer of exhausting back-and-forth mixed apologies, mixed stories, and blaming it on him that he made her dump us, she wants me to go to her 18th and I calmly said no. She also broke up with him at the end of summer.  Two of the friends in our friend group are going the rest are still mad at her or still on the fence. Unfortunately and completely coincidentally we all booked tickets for a haunted house on the same day as her party , including the friends going to her party so they will have to leave 2 hours early to hang out with the people who denied to go to her party or ghosted her.  What should I do? Should I try forgiving her?  I understand her family is strict, but am still very hurt she used us and created hangouts just to never show up to see him.  I\u2019m deeply hurt. Especially because of my 18th party and she wanted me to go to hers. AIO??  Please give me reasons and explain why I\u2019m overreacting, or not. I\u2019ve been going crazy!",
