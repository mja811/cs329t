Try to defend yourself without being nasty about it.   Regarding alcohol... I'm glad to hear you rebels are going to college next year, at first I thought you were 14. Drinking is fun and cool and makes you popular, or something, but don't go overboard. One or two drinks is enough for a  buzz and that's all the social lubrication you need.  Never ever drink alone. That's a sure sign that you're heading towards addiction.  Tune in next time for more unsolicited non-parental advice!"

  "selftext": "AITA? I, recently came back from this overnight school trip, and a lot happened. I looked really forward to this trip and planned a lot of stuff with my friends( it was the first time I was hanging out with such a big group, around 12 people in total) but somehow everything fell apart, the friend that was closest to me (I will call her Bee for convenience sake) Bee brought alcohol, and took it out in the bus (it was mixed with coke) I knew she could get in trouble but I didn't say much, since I didn't really care if she drank nor did I want to ruin the trip, she passed it to everyone she knew wouldn't mind, including me but I didn't drink, later on when we arrived at the hotel, we all met(all 12 of us) at one of the bigger suites, it all went well at the start and though I felt a bit excluded (my close friend was drunk af and clinged into this other girl idk) a few of our neighbours (also classmates) were scared because someone played the dingdong ditch against them, we found it funny but found no reason to be scared since I mean, we are about to go to college in a year. But those kids called the teachers, who later came to our room and to see if we were the ones behind it..but they chemistry teacher? She smelled the alcohol, she snooped everywhere, even checking the toilet, fortunately noting had happened in that room, and the teacher left with a warning, but my friends got shit scared, since their room had a can of absolute vodka and ciggerate buds in the can, so much so they said they'd bring it here, me and few other opposed that idea cuz we didn't want to get involved in this bs, but I still recommended ways to fix it, later, me, and four other girls (we had a  different room and the fourth one just tagged alone cuz she was too scared) went to our room and discussed this shit, but we heard the door move, one of us thought it might be someone eavesdropping, and then a teacher barged in, and asked who it was, we played dense at the beginning, but they already knew which room it was, and after pushing us for a good 10 minutes, one girl blurted it out in panic, and they went away, now my close friend refuses to talk to me, and says it is my fault for not stopping them( I don't know how I was supposed to since it was all so sudden and I couldn't just shyt the girls mouth right in front of the teachers TvT)  P.s. this is my first time posting here to idek shit  Update:- \ud83d\ude14 past me was stupid for thinking the trip was the worst part, forgot about social boycott. Bee and my other 'friends' that were nearly caught got off scot free, the girl who snitched and I devised a plan to get them out of this situation, and it worked, surprisingly. It didn't change much however and now I sit alone in most of my classes, with a fun sized amount of bullying of course. Friends with the students who weren't involved but they are in another class, I hope school is renamed to the hellhole it is. P.s. I have no clue who to tell this to, so sorry for listening to my near rant/vent :P",
