    "FFS STOP TELLING HER ANYTHING.  YTA because you keep doing this to yourself.   She can\u2019t be trusted to keep her mouth shut? Don\u2019t tell her anything.  She hijacks parties? Stop planning them with her.  You cause this drama by engaging with her. Start learning how to deal with the baby you\u2019re about to have when they grow into a toddler by learning how to deal with the toddler you call your MIL. Holy crap"

    "NTA. The only two people who have to agree on your daughter's name are you and your husband. You're in agreement. No one else's opinion matters here. Name your child whatever you want.",
    "NTA but you need to put that lady on a serious information diet, and start setting some really hard boundaries. Thank God, your husband doesn\u2019t have his head in the sand. Let her have all the tantrums she wants\u2026 She can get blocked until if/when she figures life out.",
    "NTA.  She is your child and you have the right to name her whatever you want.  You probably want to consider going LC/NC with MIL starting immediately.  Otherwise, queue the drama when you go into labor.  She'll be demanding to be in the delivery room with you.  Just because it is her first grandbaby doesn't give her any rights.  In fact, you might want to head things off and review the laws in your state about grandparent rights.  She sounds like she's unhinged enough that she might try something.  Kudos to hubby for having your back and standing up to his parents!  Sounds like he's a keeper.",
    "Name your child whatever you wish, but don't tell ANYONE, especially MIL until after the birth. In the meantime, go NC, or at the very least LC. Don't share any more pregnancy news with anyone. Good luck.",
    "NTA\u2014and really, it makes more sense for the middle names to both be the baby\u2019s great-grandmothers\u2019 names.  But be prepared for a new level of \u201cyikes\u201d from MIL",
    "You are NTA for changing the name. However, **where is your husband?**  Why is he not controlling **his** narc **mother**? He is just as guilty as enabling as everyone else in this picture save the one time he snapped.   Y\u2019all have a wishbone where spines should be. STOP telling her things. You knew she wouldn\u2019t keep it to herself and are somehow disappointed she didn\u2019t? Cut her and everyone who enables her off. Full no contact. Let her go nuclear. Let her throw tantrums. Ignore her.   Are you really going to let her around your baby? She will do things behind your back as she has proven over and over she cannot be trusted.",
    "NTA   I wouldn't want my kid named after someone like that either.",
    "Dear OP, NTA for choosing a different name because you\u2019re the parent.   However, you would be the AH  to yourself and DH if you do not set up firm boundaries now. Do not let JNMIL\u2019s over bearing and obnoxious behavior continue.   She\u2019ll probably want to be in the delivery room; move in and take over (while making rude comments); and try to get LO to call her \u201cmama\u201d. This is the hill to die on.",
    "NTA. I don\u2019t understand why you think you are. It\u2019s you and your husband\u2019s baby, no one in your family should influence your decision. This MIL is way too involved in your life. You need to set boundaries. You think she interferes now?? You haven\u2019t seen anything yet. Once the baby is born she\u2019ll practically be living at your house and EVERYTHING you do as a mother is going to be wrong.",
    "You need to move a thousand miles away. That woman is going to ruin your life and your marriage. Start looking for a job across the country.",
    "NTA-Just don\u2019t tell anyone before the birth.",
    "NTA but you two need to grow some spines. You\u2019re allowing her to get away with everything. No is a complete sentence!",
    "Does MIL know the original plan was to use one of her names? If not I can\u2019t see any need to ever mention it.",
    "NTA. MIL has proven that she isn\u2019t worthy.",
    "NTA. But you and your husband need to start setting boundaries as a team with your in-laws (yes, both of them). I don\u2019t know for sure but there\u2019s probably a good chance that she will try to raise your girl for you if you don\u2019t set boundaries. She will play the victim when you do that - it\u2019s what narcissists do. Just stay calm and stay the course. Good luck.",
    "YOU are the mother.   NOONE can sign the baby papers in the hospital but YOU. Not even your husband. A nurse will even ask everyone to leave the room, if you need time to sign the papers in privacy.   YOU can name the new baby any name you want. There are few times a mother comes first in society. This is one of the times. Do NOT give this benefit away.   This is       YOUR BABY",
    "No, you (the mother and fathet) get to choose the name of your children. Get those boundaries up high now, talking to mommy and daddy-to-be, and agree on every possible contingency now, show a united front (all you have to do is spend a couple hours on the mother-in-law reddit to become aware how unhinged  a slighted, entitled, enabled by grandpa a grandmother can be. Even decide what she'll be called now- there was even one where the new grandmother demanded the other grandmother to no longer be MeeMaw (think Sheldon Cooper) because she wanted the name but Meemaw already had 6 grandchildren calling her meemaw....",
    "NTA. My older two kids have family middle names. My third was supposed to but then she was born at 20 weeks and passed away. The family member whose middle name she was supposed to share was extremely unsupportive when she was born so I changed her middle name.",
    "You\u2019re going to have a really rough life if you don\u2019t learn to say no and stick to it. NTA but I would seek counseling to understand why making boundaries and sticking to them is so hard for you.",
    "Stop telling your MIL stuff, say you haven't decided yet, which is true since you are still changing your mind.",
    "NTA, but yesterday is the time to get your birth plan started. Password protect your medical records, talk to your medical team about who is and who is not allowed anywhere near you when you go into labour and during your hospital stay after birth.",

    "Your husband is not in the middle, he needs to be firmly on your side when it comes to these issues.  Be firm, don't argue, state what is happening and don't bend. Your husband needs to learn it's not tantrums that rule his family but love and boundaries.",

    "NTA.  You need to stop compromising!  &gt;We wanted to do a gender reveal party mother-in-law tried to hijack that event again and forced us to do it at a location that we weren\u2019t comfortable with at her sister\u2018s house because we stated we didn\u2019t want to have the party there  \"The gender reveal part is going to be at X location. If you want to go to your sister's house then do so but we're doing it at the place we chose.\"  &gt;queue World War 3.  As far as I can see, the response should be \"We've told you the situation. If you don't grow up and accept it you're not invited at all.\"  &gt;Husband and FIL get into a huge screaming match,   He doesn't need his father's permission to do anything and neither do you. FIL can scream. Husband should simply state his decision.  &gt;Husband agreed and we have since decided that daughter\u2019s second middle name will be my husband\u2019s now late grandmother\u2019s name am I the asshole for changing my daughter\u2019s middle name?  Okay. Pick the name you want. Announce the name as and when you choose.",
    "You\u2019re not really changing her name.  She isn\u2019t born yet. When you meet her in person, you might find that the lovely name you picked out doesn\u2019t suit her, or it might be just perfect.  So don\u2019t fret. This is too special a time.",

  "selftext": "Sorry about the long post guys, but this one has been eating at Me. I 31F and my husband 34M are expecting our first baby in March. We found out really early that we\u2019re having a little girl and are super excited. However, there is the problem of my mother-in-law for backstory my mother-in-law 57F has some serious control issues to the point that she hijacked our wedding and basically tried to make it what she wanted and now has effectively ruined most of the baby milestones. We haven\u2019t announced the pregnancy yet she decided to go tell the family herself when we found out the gender. We told her and told her she to keep her mouth shut. but it\u2019s her first grandbaby and didn\u2019t wanna keep it from her. Well that\u2019s where the problem started. We wanted to do a gender reveal party mother-in-law tried to hijack that event again and forced us to do it at a location that we weren\u2019t comfortable with at her sister\u2018s house because we stated we didn\u2019t want to have the party there queue World War 3. She got over the drama after my husband the saint that he is snapped on her. Now comes planning for the baby shower once again trying to involve her sister who we have no relationship with. We asked that the only stipulation we had was that we got to do the food for it because we are both chefs queue the next meltdown. Now his father 69m decided to get involved as he enables his wife. Husband and FIL get into a huge screaming match, because that was our only concession. Well this is where I may be the asshole. When we found out the gender, we decided on names we picked something non-familial for her first name and her two middle names were going to be my grandmother\u2019s middle name and MIL\u2019s middle name. Since she has caused all this drama, I told my husband I don\u2019t want MIL\u2019s name attached to our daughter as MIL has a tendency to be vindictive, cruel and narcissistic. Husband agreed and we have since decided that daughter\u2019s second middle name will be my husband\u2019s now late grandmother\u2019s name am I the asshole for changing my daughter\u2019s middle name?  Edit for context: I\u2019m done I will not control my husband\u2019s relationship with his parents but I\u2019m done I wash my hands of them they will not have a relationship with our daughter and I give not a single crap. I will not subject my innocent child to that type of manipulation. Abuse, or behavior, I don\u2019t agree with her way of being and will not allow that as an influence on my child. Period. I don\u2019t tolerate poor behavior from my own family I will not allow it from his at all. They will get no information at all and hubs is on my side 100% we hate it has come to that but actions have consequences",
