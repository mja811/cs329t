    "NTA for speaking up about BIL and SIL about dumping the kids on grandma all the time while they go to work and have money for \u201csolo\u201d vacations but not for bills.  Looks like the two brothers just bring home wives and make babies without any thought for their parents. Does anyone ever think about living independently?  I\u2019d be curious if mother-in-law and father-in-law would be far better off if you all left them in peace.",

  "selftext": "Let\u2019s start from the beginning. I joined the family back in 2018/2019. I instantly noticed the dynamic in the house was different. It was a 3 bedroom home with 8 people living there including  2 toddlers. The initial plan was my brother in law and his family were staying till they get back on there feet\u2026 8 years later and here we are still same position. So recently a lot of lies have been brought to the family\u2019s attention about him and his wife. Stating they are taking care of the bills that are in my mother in laws name however every-bill is on pink\u2026 his 2 nieces \u201croom\u201d is really the daylight room with a massive 6ft window.  Now let\u2019s get to the AITA. Recently my mother in law has been venting to us about how she feels the strain from taking care of the girls because she the one who feeds them, bathe them, takes care of them when sick. I told her son my husband we needed to say something. We then found out his brother lied about going on a work trip and really took a paid vaca \u201cby himself\u201d. Two weeks later his wife took vaca \u201cby herself\u201d. We confronted his brother and told him how this was not right and I said a lot more details about things I knew about like the coworker he was cheating on his wife with\u2026 I believe she is cheating as well bc once she found out nothing was done at all.   Well yesterday my mother in law called us to see if we could babysit the girls bc they \u201cgot sick\u201d and were dropped off at the house even tho grandma and grandpa had plans.   We sent them a text asking why one of them could not take off a couple of hours to watch the girls. They both proceeded to claim they couldn\u2019t bc the vaca they individually took. I told them it sounded like a personal problem but that this was not okay bc they just ruined the grandparents plans. They both called grandma and got mad at her for calling us bc it was \u201cnot our concern\u201d. We then told them it was bc mom called and then they changed tunes saying \u201cshe misunderstood and miscommunicated to y\u2019all what\u2019s happening\u201d. We said there no miscommunication y\u2019all did a drop off with out actually asking then they both called individually saying they were on the way home and it\u2019s under control. I said it\u2019s under control because we said something but what\u2019s y\u2019all plan so we know if we need to go. Sister in law says \u201cI\u2019m on the way home right now\u201d. She picked up the girls at 1:30 went back to work till 3:30 and claimed she was getting off at 4:30. If she got off early after we said something why not that be the initial plan. So they both said \u201cthanks for y\u2019all concern and since watching the girls is such a big inconvenience we will never ask y\u2019all for help again\u201d mind you they have never asked us for help they always just leave and expect grandma and grandpa to watch.   GMA and gpa are so scared to say something because they have taken the girls away before from there other grandparents when they lived with them bc they didn\u2019t get there way.   AITA for saying something.  Ps. They are both managers at the place they work for and grandparents are 75 &amp;78 years old. This is also our first time saying something in the past 6/7 years, we do not live there and haven\u2019t since they moved in.",
