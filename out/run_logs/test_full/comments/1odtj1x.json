    "The gentlest YTA. He may not have seen the text and came upstairs, realized he had no idea where his kiddo or you were and that momentary where's my kid fear is pretty primal. In the future make sure he acknowledges he's aware you're leaving before you leave. Just to avoid panic by dad."
  ],
  "NTA": [
    "All this drama is because you ended your text with a period instead of a question mark? Nta. Your BIL is ridiculous",
    "NTA Are you doing this as a favor? His entitlement to your help, without even feeling the need to be polite and grateful, says a lot about him. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong in any way.",
    "NTA. For someone who wants a babysitter. Bc he\u2019s at home, he is unnecessarily anal. \u201cPhrase it like a question\u201d is ridiculous. He should watch his own kid if this is necessary.",
    "NTA. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. You were delegated responsibility over the kid. You already knew more or less the routine. You had already gone to park before and it was ok. You even let BIL know where you were going. It wasn\u2019t like you took your nephew to some unknown place or kidnapped him.  Does BIL have separation anxiety or something? Idk how he will be able to deal with it when he has to send the kid to preschool.",
    "NTA. They need to start paying a babysitter they (hopefully) feel less free to abuse.",
    "NTA you let him know you\u2019re taking your nephew to the park. He\u2019s angry it was a statement and not a question. He\u2019s being ridiculous and extremely ungrateful. You\u2019re not your BIL\u2019s punching bag. He\u2019s not your husband. You don\u2019t have to coddle his feelings or stoke his ego. Stop babysitting.",
    "NTA Sounds like a household where they walk on eggshells around husband.",
    "NTA  If I was working from home and the babysitter sent a text stating they were going to the park,  I'd be overjoyed. Kid gets fresh air and exercise and the house is quiet for an hour, win/win",
    "NTA, but your BIL sure is. \"Just let them know\" when you want to take nephew to the park carries the implication that you just need to inform, not ask permission and wait for a response.   Without context, perhaps BIL did freak out because he didn't see the text, was embarrassed that he overreacted, so tried to cover by saying you should have phrased it as a question, but that assumes this isn't a pattern of controlling behavior. Your sister saying it's better to \"phrase it like a question\" casts doubt on that, though. I wonder if she herself has to phrase everything that way.   I think maybe it's best if you continue to babysit your nephew (to maintain contact with him and your sis incase husband gets more controlling), but not at their house, if that is an option.",
    "NTA. Don't understand the issue. You cleared it with both of them first. Presumably you want to babysit again, so asking exactly what went wrong would probably be a good idea",
    "Tell them with these shitty ass rules they can hire a babysitter",
    "NTA  I can understand the sudden surge of anxiety when you don't know where your kid is for a split second. It's not a good feeling.\u00a0  That being said he's using the punctuation in a text as a technicality to not apologize to you. \u00a0He owes you an apology."

    "Might not matter but what age are you? Are you seen as super responsible or was their a reason it took 2 years to get this honour of being allowed to watch you nephew?  Also, did you message the other 2 days and that was fine because you worded it as a request? Or was this the first time you messages and worded it as you are doing this rather than asking?"

  "selftext": "I don\u2019t have kids so I wanted to gauge how I turn out in this story. I have a nephew that is 2yo and 2 days ago was the first time I was asked by my sister to babysit. (I had been asking to babysit since he was born). I was super excited and moved my work schedule so I could do it. Note: when anyone is asked to babysit, her Husband is always home. He works at home and they have someone babysit so he can focus on working.  The babysitting was for a couple hours in the morning, everything seemed to go well. I had checked with my sister beforehand to ask if I could take my nephew to the park a half block away. Her husband said to just let him know when I was taking him. I did. I was also asked to babysit yesterday, again everything went fine. Fast forward to today, I was asked to babysit again. (My BIL was home) I texted him to let him know I was taking my nephew for a walk.   So this is where AITA comes in. He called me a couple minutes later asking where I was at, clearly angry. He said they really prefer if people ask permission before taking their son anywhere because \u201cyou just freak out if your kid is gone\u201d. I said I could definitely bring him back no problem. He said no it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m just saying. (Annoyed/angry the whole time) When I got back he didn\u2019t come upstairs through the whole time even up to when I left their house. I also told my sister about the situation and she said its better if I phrase things as a question.. Again I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong because I did text beforehand and the park is literally just a half block away in an enclosed neighborhood. But I also don\u2019t have kids so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s normal? AITA?",
