    "I get where you're coming from, your brother sounds hella frustrating. But leave the parenting to the parents. You don't want to get in the middle of what sounds like a real shitshow.",
    "YTA: Try and have more empathy.  He\u2019s a kid caught between two fighting parents, bouncing between two homes with completely different rules and expectations. I don\u2019t blame him for struggling to understand why the rules are different between them.  He\u2019s not handling their co-parenting well, obviously. That doesn\u2019t mean he deserves to be punished at Christmas. I honestly blame the parents far more for the situation.  Taking away Christmas gifts is only going to harm his relationship with his mother further. He has only just started coming around again. The focus should be on rebuilding his relationship with her.  Honestly, it is also 100% not your place to judge whether he\u2019s 'earned' christmas gifts. This whole situation is something your mum should handle, not you.",
    "YTA. This situation has nothing to do with you. Mind your own business.",
    "He acts like a big-time brat but he also has another parent who seems to be pulling some strings. With that, excluding him from receiving gifts is going to make him want to stay away even more, which hurts your mother. Of course this doesn\u2019t mean she should go all out to bribe him because he\u2019ll learn that acting out results in rewards. It\u2019s ultimately her decision. I understand your frustration though.",
    "Yes, YTA. You're not the parent here. Telling your mom to not give her son gifts for Christmas would be AH behavior. Stereotypical older child.   But let me add: do you really think your brother was entirely to blame for this? He's 11. You should be able to connect the dots and realize that your father likely influenced him or wouldn't let him go home. The way this post is worded makes it seem like you're putting the full blame on your brother, which is... very closed-minded.",
    "YTA 1. This isn't your place. It's up to your mom to decide how to parent your brother. 2. You aren't thinking like a parent. You are thinking like another kid in the house and you don't have the same judgment your mom has. 3. Even though you are in the same house as your brother you are not living the same experience due to age and other factors. You have no idea how he truly feels. 4. Your opinion also seems to be tainted about how you feel about his father and stepmother.   Long story short just do what you're supposed to do and let your mom handle your brother.",
    "Leave the gifts out of it. But I do think you should say something like \"Mom, I know you want brother to keep coming back here. But it is really messed up that he keeps breaking rules and doing whatever the heck he wants. He should respect you more. You are a wonderful mom.\" Hug and walk away.",
    "YTA. This reads a lot more like you want to hurt your brother rather than help your mother or even help your brother to become a better person and follow the rules. You have to keep in mind that your mother is trying to teach you rules and responsibilities and turn you into functional adults (hopefully). And she WANTS to do the same for your brother (again, hopefully), but your brother's father is spewing poison into his ear and letting him do whatever in an attempt to hurt your mother and she has to bend a bit just to make sure she doesn't lose him completely from what I've read here. Forcing extreme punishments like nothing for Christmas is only going to drive your brother to his father and away from your mother.",
    "YTA because this isn't up to you.  What I would do in your situation is study as much as you can, get the best grades possible, get a part time job to save for college and as soon as you can, leave this toxic situation.  You are taking on problems that aren't yours rather than focusing on your future.",
    "I\u2019m not going to call you an AH. But you need to not worry about this. It\u2019s simply none of your business.   How your mother chooses to parent or not parent your brother isn\u2019t your choice. You don\u2019t get a say in how your mother parents, what she gets who for Christmas, etc.",
    "YTA because you\u2019re his sister not his parent. This isn\u2019t for you to solve. Support your mom but the problem is his father allowing all the bs.",
    "YTA.  You're not a co-parent.  Stay out of it.  And every other person is a narcissist these days.  Quit diagnosing people unless you're a professional.",
    "Edit because I missed op\u2019s age  Your brother is a victim of his narcissistic manipulative father as well. The father is using him as a weapon of revenge against your mom.",
    "YTA for not knowing how to summarise or use paragraphs. Also for being rather an officious brat, inserting yourself in parenting issues."

    "You are not an AH. However, you also are not a parent and it\u2019s not your responsibility to manage the family. Time to stop interfering. As someone who managed a family far before I was prepared, it\u2019s not good for your brain, your emotions, your grades to being parenting at 16. Your mom needs to stop going out at night and be present for her family. You need to be at school, doing your work, and maybe even getting a job so you can stay out of the house and start socking money away so you can leave ASAP.",
    "Absolutely wild how many adults are calling you, a teenager in a bad home environment, an AH for trying to help. (Even if that\u2019s not your job!)",
    "You\u2019re nta  you\u2019re having feelings that are being created by a really difficult situation. You are doing what most eldest children would do but it\u2019s not healthy for you to carry this responsibility. I\u2019m so sorry this is happening. Maybe tell mom how your brother\u2019s behavior is impacting you. Good luck.",
    "NTA\u2026you have been put in a tough spot and if I\u2019m interpreting this correctly, you have a different dad, your two brothers have the same dad and your younger sister has a different dad. You are probably asked to pick up the slack on a lot of parenting duties which is not fair to you. However, you are not equipped to label anyone a narcissist, so don\u2019t throw around labels. That all being said, it\u2019s not your place to demand your mother to not buy him Christmas gifts. But again\u2026NTA",
    "You NTA. You\u2019re a kid and your mom shouldn\u2019t be \u201cgoing out with friends\u201d at night if it makes her kids feel uncomfortable in any way. Your mom also shouldn\u2019t be putting you in this situation and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re being forced to grow up so young. Give yourself some grace and try to focus on your future.",
    "NTA it sounds like your bros dad has a favourite son and it's him. He allows him to do whatever he wants and probably poisons himself against your mom constantly. So that bleeds on to your bro and the way he acts.   I'm sure your mom won't not give him gifts but I agree he doesn't need a ton. Maybe one thing for each kid. However, your mom can save that money and reward the other kid with gifts over the year or something for being good (this way your bro learns).  You are only 16 tho, so try and have fun and stay out of it all of you can. You're being. A good daughter and sister where you can but don't forget about you.   Reddit is harsh so don't pay the nasty comments too much attention. You are doing what's best for your family and the reality you live in, not everyone can live in fantasy land like redditors",
    "NTA. He\u2019s a narcissistic a-hole just like his father and he\u2019s making everything worse. He\u2019s not following the rules your mom put in place for screen time. You\u2019re right in the title though. He shouldn\u2019t get any Christmas gifts at all this year because of the attitude he\u2019s got going on. Talk with your mom about this and see if she agrees with you or not."

    "Hon, I\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019re NTA, but both your parents are. Your father has manipulated your little brother, who is too young and dumb to know he is being manipulated. He doesn\u2019t love the kid, if he did he wouldn\u2019t do this. He just wants to win. Your mother is so upset that she has capitulated and is now playing your father\u2019s game, which means a dimwit 13 year old is running both houses. This is bad news for everyone. Your mom should have held firm for the sake of you and your siblings. Your brother needs to understand that he is not the boss, because he\u2019s clearly not capable of regulating himself. This is bigger than Christmas presents. I understand the urge not to reward him for bad behavior, but she\u2019s too scared that he will see it as a rejection and she won\u2019t do it.   Your mom\u2019s rules aren\u2019t wrong. Life is hard enough and exceptionally uncertain right now. Your mom is trying to instill self-motivation and determination into the rest of you, and to keep you from spending all your time on things like gaming, that can take over our lives and keep us from functioning. Self-regulating as a teenager can be really hard, which is why good parents set limits to help us do that. Having the self-discipline to do the hard stuff, the stuff that\u2019s not so fun, the important stuff, is what will  give us the opportunities to have a better life in the long run. Giving in to every dopamine urge just makes that harder, and like all addiction it just gets worse over time. It makes it too easy to hide from life. Your brother is not on a good road, and in my opinion your mom isn\u2019t handling it well because she\u2019s letting her own emotions override what is better for your brother. Now that he knows he can manipulate her and that there are no rules, he will keep pushing boundaries until he completely crashes.    You can\u2019t fix this. You can certainly tell your brother what you think of his behavior, but this is too big for you to solve. The best thing you can do is to realize that taking your brother\u2019s path is a bad idea, and keep helping your younger siblings to the extent you can. I\u2019m sorry your mom isn\u2019t stepping up, but it\u2019s not your fault.",

    "How old are you? It sounds like there are a lot of moving pieces here. I\u2019m sorry that your mom is using you as a coparent for your younger siblings.  It\u2019s hard to feel responsible for their wellbeing on a regular basis, and also feel like you don\u2019t get any say in their rules or consequences.   In my opinion, Christmas isn\u2019t a good time for punishments.    I would tell your mom she\u2019s asking too much of you, and move out if you\u2019re over 18, but I\u2019m guessing based on the story that your mom has some mental health issues of her own she\u2019s dealing with. Sorry you are in a tough situation",
    "Stop trying to be the parent.  If she fails and he becomes a leech that also won't be your issue.   Now it is fair to tell her that you are not happy with the unequal treatment.   It isn't fair that he gets to do X and you don't.   Ask her why she is OK with that and then listen.  It would also be fair to point out she is enabling him to be an entitled brat and that won't help him be independent and a functioning member of society and that after you are 18 you get the choice of whether you associate with him or not and that you won't pick up ANY of the slack or costs for her as a result of him.",

    "The people in this comment section are rude af jesus christ. You're doing fine, you're doing your best. At the same time, you're 16, it isn't your responsibility to parent anyone. I know that instinct is coming from a good place, wanting to make sure your siblings and your mom are okay. As their older sibling, all you can really do is be there for them. It isn't your responsibility to dole out punishments.    Have you tried talking to your brother? If I was in his shoes, I know I would be hurting for someone to talk to, or just anyone in my corner. Growing up is hard. He's caught in between your parents right now, and I'm sure that feels isolating.",
    "Idk about the present situation but as for the 1hr of vr time (or other timed things) that he doesn't like to stick to, start warning him BEFORE the time is up. (It should actually be your mum warning him because she's the parent, not you but...) When I worked with kids, it worked better to tell them \"you've got 30, 10, 5 ect mins left\" because then it wasn't a sudden stop for the kid and they had time to prepare for it. We used it for timed stuff and stuff that was happening at specific times so that the kids weren't surprised and scrambling when it was suddenly time."

    "You should get less Christmas gifts for not knowing how to format a proper story. Learn to use paragraphs, please.

When you have children, you can decide what to do for Christmas."

  "selftext": "So this year has been rough for my family. My mother is a single parent of 4 including me (16f), my two brothers, and sister. I am the oldest of her children and been having to step up lately.  Earlier this year him and my mother had a fight about his screen time. It has always been 1 hour on vr for everyone, including me but he has always had trouble listening to this rule. He normally gets angry when I try to rush him off after he passes and hour and when I give him an extra 5 mintues he still won\u2019t get off when I tell him. At one point he started getting in before my mother was awake or sneaking on without asking. Him and my mother fought about how he needs to respect her rules or he can\u2019t bring use the headset or bring the one from his fathers house. My brothers dad doesn\u2019t care how much they go on electronics. My mom and their dad switch weeks with them on Sunday's each week. My youngest brother(11m) doesn\u2019t ever think the rules are unfair.  When my mother and brother had an argument about the rules he went to his dads the next day like normal but when it came the night to pick him up, his father told my mother that he wouldn\u2019t come, he didn\u2019t feel comfortable. My mom was asking for a reason since it was the week of spring break but my brothers dad said he was scared of when she left at night to see her friends (which she does once a month) even though I am here and capable of texting her if something\u2019s wrong and we have big dogs to protect us. All me and my siblings don\u2019t mind when she has left in the past since she returns before 12 and is never drunk or acting wild, she always checks in and makes sure everyone is okay beforehand.  My mother went to talk to him and see if he would come to our house or just talk but at their fathers house, his father tried making my mother talk to him through the screen door as him and his wife listened. Long story short he started getting persuaded to go with my mother but saw his father and closed up. Just so everyone knows, his father is a narcissist (professionally diagnosed) and him and his wife have been discreetly harassing my mother for months.   My mother was absolutely heart broken because she loves her children and does her best, the whole situation making her mental state much worse. For the next few months she only saw him during his sports games and she would cry after, clearly distressed and wanting to see him more. She and my brothers dad went to court. He tried to get full custody of one, key word, one of my brothers while supervised visits from my mom. He didn\u2019t talk about his other son which made it more suspicious. To shorten this, the judge told him he had to make my brothers come to our house. My brothers dad didnt exactly listen but after another court session my brother slowly started coming back.   Lately is the problem: My brother come to our house he acts like rules dont apply to him, he can eat junk food, doesnt have to do chores, and can just sit on his phone (that wasnt even supposed to be at our house but after an incident, it is). Now all hes been talking about are gifts and things he wants even though he doesnt do anything.   AITA for thinking he shouldn\u2019t have gifts after how he has impacted my mother and our family life?  Edit: Yes, I know I shouldn\u2019t be trying to parent but my mom has been giving into all his wishes he\u2019s asked for and after his fathers words towards her, hasn\u2019t been parenting him how she used to and how she does us. I haven\u2019t said anything yet but have been inching towards mentioning his behavior. I\u2019m taking all comments into consideration.",
