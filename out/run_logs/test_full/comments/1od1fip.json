    "NTA  However it\u2019s impossible to control what others do. With roommates you cannot ban but you can compromise.  In an unrelated note are assigned coed roommates a thing now?",
    "Definitely not the asshole. This is your place to live as much as it's hers. When you move out and get a roommate, it comes with compromises, and this is just the first one you two will have to work together to resolve. If you're uncomfortable with her company, then she should understand that and accommodate. I would just explain to her how his presence is personally affecting you. If you don't mind him coming over, cool, but you need to communicate your compromise clearly: he can be there during the day, but sleepovers will have to be at his place. Definitely ask her to no longer have him spend the night, as him being over during the day is fine. However, when it comes to night, it's affecting your sleep and you would appreciate the corroboration.",
    "NTA  Must be an RA if it's college accomodation? - I would chat to them and ask if they can help you talk to your roommate/set boundaries with roommates's boyfriend. You deserve to be comfortable in your own home.",
    "NTA. Have the dorm authorities keep him out. I assume that your roommate has no right to have strangers in your room. If the dorm authorities disagree, then request a transfer.",
    "Tell the RA they'll tell her no ones allowed to sleep over, simple as, and no YNTA",
    "If you explain the situation calmly to your roommate, focusing on how it\u2019s affecting you, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll understand.",
    "See your RA or whoever is in charge of helping with residential issues.  Ask for a new assignment or for your current roommate to be moved.  NTA but don't let things \"slide\" anymore and be sure you set down rules with future roommates about overnight stays.",
    "NTA.  You have a roommate, not 2.  Also, he is not paying for any of the rent.  I can see a couple sleepovers per month but then the fact that you don't feel safe cancels that out.  No sleepovers.",
    "Geniuine question because this is baffling to me as a British person. How on earth does college room sharing work with having partners sleep over. As a woman, being forced to share with a strange man sounds hellish. How are you supposed to get changed with a random guy there? Or wear just a t shirt to bed? Or avoid seeing random guys naked? Or feel safe- what if he's a creep? Crazy.   (obviously might be different in OP's case with him being trans. This is a general question)",
    "What? There\u2019s no question, that guy needs to stop staying over. Period.  That\u2019s your personal space."

  "ESH": [
    "NTA for wanting to protect your peace, BUT  YWBTA for enforcing a ban on the space like that if it isn't explicitly yours to decide who can stay and who can't. You should really talk to your roommate about how he sometimes makes you uncomfortable and would rather if he didn't sleep over. If she's reasonable as you believe, it shouldn't be a problem to at least compromise that he does it less often."

  "INFO": [
    "NTA.  You owe to yourself making sure your rest and sleep time have some quality, to the best of your range (discussing with roommate and, if didn\u2019t solve, with whoever organizes the accommodations).  But I don\u2019t think you can expect to do this without indisposing yourself with your roommate or her bf.  Either way, they\u2019re the ones bringing persisting problems to your life. Why are you worried they\u2019ll be bothered by you pointing it out?"

  "selftext": "First time posting on Reddit cause all my friends are asleep. I roommate (M19) am a college and like many have a roommate. We were randomly assigned and I got a reasonable roommate (F19). She was seeing this guy (M20) and I was fine with him spending the night sometimes. He seemed fine to be so I didn\u2019t really care. Over the past few weeks he has been getting really upset/angry at something (usually something me or my roommate said) with not communication of why, being overall unhygienic, and overly blunt to the point of coming off as a bit rude. I\u2019ve been trying to let it slide since I\u2019m typically not one for confrontation but it\u2019s gotten to the point where sleepovers are a nightmare. Not to get to deep but I am a very traumatized person, so if I do not feel safe around someone sleeping/going to sleep I cannot sleep. I do not feel 100% safe around him and because of this it has made any time he spends the night my own personal hell, this lack of sleep on top of my pre-existing chronic illness has caused me to feel sick. But I don\u2019t want him to feel like he\u2019s not welcome/hurt my roommates feelings as he\u2019s over what feels like a reasonable amount. But I don\u2019t want this to mess with college. So tell me would I be the asshole?",
