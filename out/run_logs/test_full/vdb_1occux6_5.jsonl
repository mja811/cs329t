{"selftext": "I don\u2019t have kids so I wanted to gauge how I turn out in this story. I have a nephew that is 2yo and 2 days ago was the first time I was asked by my sister to babysit. (I had been asking to babysit since he was born). I was super excited and moved my work schedule so I could do it. Note: when anyone is asked to babysit, her Husband is always home. He works at home and they have someone babysit so he can focus on working.  The babysitting was for a couple hours in the morning, everything seemed to go well. I had checked with my sister beforehand to ask if I could take my nephew to the park a half block away. Her husband said to just let him know when I was taking him. I did. I was also asked to babysit yesterday, again everything went fine. Fast forward to today, I was asked to babysit again. (My BIL was home) I texted him to let him know I was taking my nephew for a walk.   So this is where AITA comes in. He called me a couple minutes later asking where I was at, clearly angry. He said they really prefer if people ask permission before taking their son anywhere because \u201cyou just freak out if your kid is gone\u201d. I said I could definitely bring him back no problem. He said no it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m just saying. (Annoyed/angry the whole time) When I got back he didn\u2019t come upstairs through the whole time even up to when I left their house. I also told my sister about the situation and she said its better if I phrase things as a question.. Again I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong because I did text beforehand and the park is literally just a half block away in an enclosed neighborhood. But I also don\u2019t have kids so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s normal?

{"selftext": "Old playground, new equipment. The area is suburban. Grew up literally 3 houses from this park. Myself (41f), my son (8m), husband(42m) and dog were all at park.   I was attending to my son on the playground, he wanted me there, nearby, to take pics of his jumps.  He pointed out a specific swing there is only one of on the playground. Ppl were on it. We played on other things. I waited for it while he swang some more. It became available and I went to get it.  A younger girl met me at the swing doing the same thing. My son was just getting off the other swing l, so I told her, you go ahead, I'll get next.  Cut to 25 minutes later, and her and her cousins really seeming to enjoy watching me wait. No concern for my kid who is now plopped down, as we've now done everything else and still waiting.  My husband has also now been watching us wait while with our dog at a table.  Finally, the young girl I initially gave a turn to started to get off, so I go to grab it. She says, no,  we're not done. I say, ladies, we've waiting 25 minutes. They say another friend wants a turn, I say she needs to wait until my son and i were done. They flat out refuse.  I tell them, no really its our turn. And older cousin (all these girls are likely 10-17) starts yelling in my face saying I can't talk to them, their children etc. Finally their moms come over,  start yelling at me, repeating their daughters, that I'm talking to children, how dare I. I was stunned they flipped, totally ignoring their children were acting like little brats.  I just walked away at tjat point, they weren't going to hear my side that I was simply trying to be a village cause their children were not taking turns. I got in the car and bawled my eyes out.  Silver lining, my husband and son went back and my son got his turn.  But my god, I really don't think I was  in the wrong, I have a 13 year old and would have wanted someone to tell him to let other ppl use the equipment.

{"selftext": "So my sister and I planned a family vacation together. We rented a big house for both our families. It was me, my wife, our 1 year old, our dog, and my sister with her husband and their two kids who are 5 and 3. The house was big enough that her in laws stayed with us during the first week and our parents came in the second week.  Our dog is a rescue she is very sweet but gets nervous around new people. She knows both our families really well and loves the kids and my brother in law but she had never met his parents before. So we made it clear that she would always be leashed when they were around and that my wife or I would always be there.  Two days into the trip my sister\u2019s MIL told me she is great with dogs and asked me if she could give her a treat. I said yes but I explained exactly how to do it safely. I told her to get down low so she would not tower over the dog and to move slowly. She said okay but immediately did the opposite. She leaned over her and reached down and the dog got scared and jumped up on her. I pulled the dog back right away and told her that for the rest of the week it would be better if she did not try to interact with the dog.  She seemed fine with that so I thought that was the end of it.  Two days later everyone else was out. It was just me, our baby, Sisters MIL+FIL and one of the older kids in the house. I was on the floor playing with my kid when I heard them talking very loudly at the dining table. It was that kind of loud where it feels like they actually want you to hear it. They were saying things like we will have to get it repaired when we get home and maybe we can find someone cheap to fix it.  I could not really ignore it so I asked what was broken and what needed fixing. She said that one of the kids had brought her her broken ankle bracelet. She said she was not sure what happened. Maybe it broke while she was on the trampoline or bumped into sonething, or maybe it was when the dog jumped at her earlier that week.  I said oh okay that sucks and left it at that. Nobody mentioned it again and the topic never came up once for the next 4 days that they stayed.  Fast forward two weeks after the vacation. My sister called me and said her in laws had a bracelet repaired and now they wanted me to send them 100 dollars for the repair.  I was honestly shocked. I called my sisters MIL right away and asked what that was about. She said she thought it must have been the dog when she jumped up on her. I reminded her that she ignored my clear instructions and that she was not even sure if it was the dog since she had mentioned several other reasons.  I told her that if she had talked to me honestly during the trip and said she thought my dog broke it I might have helped pay. But she said nothing, waited two weeks, and then sent the bill. So I told her no, I was not paying.  Now she is upset and told my sister I am an asshole So Reddit.

{"selftext": "So today I took my kids to get their shots, offered because alot of times my wife struggles to sleep. So she can sleepin a bit . This gives her time to get ready and once im done I meet her and she gets one of the kids and take to school and I take the other (divide and conquer). In the past I usually go to the cafeteria (Army hospital) after the shots to get food for lunch for myself and whatever the kids want. I usually call my wife to ask if she wants anything and every time she says no. Today I failed to call to ask and she goes off on me as to why I didnt call her to ask and that she would have wanted a sandwich. Now shes telling me cusing me out and dropping f bombs. I did apologize and admitted I failed to call her and she continued and to not call her for the rest of the day. Naturally I got upset too because here im focusing on trying to take care of the kids, I even offered to take one of the kids to school because she was going to take both (we both work and i was late in). I know im wrong to some extent but is she overreacting?

{"selftext": "Sorry about the long post guys, but this one has been eating at Me. I 31F and my husband 34M are expecting our first baby in March. We found out really early that we\u2019re having a little girl and are super excited. However, there is the problem of my mother-in-law for backstory my mother-in-law 57F has some serious control issues to the point that she hijacked our wedding and basically tried to make it what she wanted and now has effectively ruined most of the baby milestones. We haven\u2019t announced the pregnancy yet she decided to go tell the family herself when we found out the gender. We told her and told her she to keep her mouth shut. but it\u2019s her first grandbaby and didn\u2019t wanna keep it from her. Well that\u2019s where the problem started. We wanted to do a gender reveal party mother-in-law tried to hijack that event again and forced us to do it at a location that we weren\u2019t comfortable with at her sister\u2018s house because we stated we didn\u2019t want to have the party there queue World War 3. She got over the drama after my husband the saint that he is snapped on her. Now comes planning for the baby shower once again trying to involve her sister who we have no relationship with. We asked that the only stipulation we had was that we got to do the food for it because we are both chefs queue the next meltdown. Now his father 69m decided to get involved as he enables his wife. Husband and FIL get into a huge screaming match, because that was our only concession. Well this is where I may be the asshole. When we found out the gender, we decided on names we picked something non-familial for her first name and her two middle names were going to be my grandmother\u2019s middle name and MIL\u2019s middle name. Since she has caused all this drama, I told my husband I don\u2019t want MIL\u2019s name attached to our daughter as MIL has a tendency to be vindictive, cruel and narcissistic. Husband agreed and we have since decided that daughter\u2019s second middle name will be my husband\u2019s now late grandmother\u2019s name am I the asshole for changing my daughter\u2019s middle name?  Edit for context: I\u2019m done I will not control my husband\u2019s relationship with his parents but I\u2019m done I wash my hands of them they will not have a relationship with our daughter and I give not a single crap. I will not subject my innocent child to that type of manipulation. Abuse, or behavior, I don\u2019t agree with her way of being and will not allow that as an influence on my child. Period. I don\u2019t tolerate poor behavior from my own family I will not allow it from his at all. They will get no information at all and hubs is on my side 100% we hate it has come to that but actions have consequences", "post_id": "1octkde", "title": "AITA for changing my daughters middle name", "flair": "Asshole", "created_utc": 1761092133, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1octkde/aita_for_changing_my_daughters_middle_name/", "downs": 0, "ups": 54, "score": 54}
