{"selftext": "AITA? Needing some opinions if I am in the wrong here. I have been divorced 3 years this November. My ex mother in law and I don\u2019t really have a close relationship but we are always civil and I make sure my son stays very involved with her as a grandmother. My ex mother in law is a Realtor and I looked at homes with her in April but decided to wait and keep saving. Since then, I have been having issues with my ex husband (I started dating again in may and he\u2019s livid) and so it has resulted in distancing myself from his family over the past 6 months due to their very vocal opinions of me dating again after 3 years of being single.  I started looking at home again for various agents and last week I reconnected with the builder (she introduced me to in April) and signed a contract on a home he\u2019s building . My son was very involved in this and out of excitement let his dad know we are buying a house. Long story short, my ex mother in law found out and called the builder behind my back demanding to be added to the contract to get a commission (went on for 48 hours before I found out) The builder obviously could not do this because one, she was not physical there when the home was shown and she is not representing me. We never signed a buyer/rep agreement. She tried emailing one that was back dated but I refused to sign one, to me that is unethical and dishonest. I was very thankful she took the time back in April to show me 2 homes but we were in such a different place in our relationship and I also want to add she repeatedly told me she was going to waive her commission and put it toward closing costs. She harassed me for days over this and my ex husband withheld my child from me and we missed a paid for vacation last week to visit family (we have a decree but have never followed it) so since it was technically his time I lost out on the whole trip. I have been told they will no longer help me when needed etc etc. After not being to see or speak to my child for days, I called the builder and begged him to add her because of the drama it was causing which he declined to do so on ethics. As of today I backed out of the home, it was a week of emotional turmoil which I thought buying my first home as a single mother would be a happy time. It is. Is being spun by my exes entire family I did her wrong and karma will be paid back.

{"selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m [22 F] new to Reddit so please forgive me if my post is not up to Reddit standards. I wanted to ask if I am the asshole for telling my mother she should\u2019ve just stayed in California.   Basically, she went on a week and half long vacation with her fiancee and while she was gone, I took care of my three younger siblings who are 14,16, and 18. This means sending them to school and work outside of our usual driving to hang out and things of the sort. I don\u2019t mind doing this, I love my siblings and although gas is expensive and I\u2019m not really making that much money, I do what I can because I know there is no one else to help.   We had a really peaceful week; we all delegated tasks and knew what chores to do and yes they fought here and there, but it was actually really nice to have them both gone. I picked them both up from the airport tonight and I already knew it was going to be bad when we got home.   I will admit, I didn\u2019t do some things my mother wanted me to do before she left (moving some of my new furniture downstairs into my room), but other than that, we kept the entire house clean and even cleaned and cooked before she came back to make sure when she came home it would be less stressful.   My mother and her fiancee ate dinner but I could tell she was already in a bad mood, which is understandable after a long flight, but when she got out of the shower and saw my little sister looking for her AirPods rather than being asleep (it was only 10:30 pm) she just kinda went off on us both. Talking about how she does too much for us and how she should\u2019ve just stayed in California and how we didn\u2019t even clean the bathroom.   My younger sister told her that yes she should\u2019ve just stayed over there since she clearly doesn\u2019t want to be here and I will admit I felt hurt, this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done something like this after being away. I told her that the next she time she leaves to go on vacation or wherever she goes to just stay until she\u2019s happy or just not come back at all because she always does this and it drags everyone\u2019s mood down and that we did our best to keep the house clean and that I don\u2019t know what it was she wanted from us but it doesn\u2019t matter because she\u2019s like this every time she comes back.  She didn\u2019t say anything and now I am wondering if I am the asshole for saying those things?", "post_id": "1oczhuk", "title": "AITA for telling my mom she should have stayed in California?", "flair": "Not the A-hole", "created_utc": 1761109794, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oczhuk/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_should_have_stayed_in/", "downs": 0, "ups": 464, "score": 464}
{"selftext": "Let\u2019s start from the beginning. I joined the family back in 2018/2019. I instantly noticed the dynamic in the house was different. It was a 3 bedroom home with 8 people living there including  2 toddlers. The initial plan was my brother in law and his family were staying till they get back on there feet\u2026 8 years later and here we are still same position. So recently a lot of lies have been brought to the family\u2019s attention about him and his wife. Stating they are taking care of the bills that are in my mother in laws name however every-bill is on pink\u2026 his 2 nieces \u201croom\u201d is really the daylight room with a massive 6ft window.  Now let\u2019s get to the AITA. Recently my mother in law has been venting to us about how she feels the strain from taking care of the girls because she the one who feeds them, bathe them, takes care of them when sick. I told her son my husband we needed to say something. We then found out his brother lied about going on a work trip and really took a paid vaca \u201cby himself\u201d. Two weeks later his wife took vaca \u201cby herself\u201d. We confronted his brother and told him how this was not right and I said a lot more details about things I knew about like the coworker he was cheating on his wife with\u2026 I believe she is cheating as well bc once she found out nothing was done at all.   Well yesterday my mother in law called us to see if we could babysit the girls bc they \u201cgot sick\u201d and were dropped off at the house even tho grandma and grandpa had plans.   We sent them a text asking why one of them could not take off a couple of hours to watch the girls. They both proceeded to claim they couldn\u2019t bc the vaca they individually took. I told them it sounded like a personal problem but that this was not okay bc they just ruined the grandparents plans. They both called grandma and got mad at her for calling us bc it was \u201cnot our concern\u201d. We then told them it was bc mom called and then they changed tunes saying \u201cshe misunderstood and miscommunicated to y\u2019all what\u2019s happening\u201d. We said there no miscommunication y\u2019all did a drop off with out actually asking then they both called individually saying they were on the way home and it\u2019s under control. I said it\u2019s under control because we said something but what\u2019s y\u2019all plan so we know if we need to go. Sister in law says \u201cI\u2019m on the way home right now\u201d. She picked up the girls at 1:30 went back to work till 3:30 and claimed she was getting off at 4:30. If she got off early after we said something why not that be the initial plan. So they both said \u201cthanks for y\u2019all concern and since watching the girls is such a big inconvenience we will never ask y\u2019all for help again\u201d mind you they have never asked us for help they always just leave and expect grandma and grandpa to watch.   GMA and gpa are so scared to say something because they have taken the girls away before from there other grandparents when they lived with them bc they didn\u2019t get there way.   AITA for saying something.  Ps. They are both managers at the place they work for and grandparents are 75 &amp;78 years old. This is also our first time saying something in the past 6/7 years, we do not live there and haven\u2019t since they moved in.", "post_id": "1ocguy7", "title": "AITA for speaking up!", "flair": "Asshole", "created_utc": 1761062425, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ocguy7/aita_for_speaking_up/", "downs": 0, "ups": 15, "score": 15}
{"selftext": "For context, I (17F) and my friend (16F) have been friends since we were 4 and 5. Things didn't really change until last year. My old best friend \\[Ill call her Alice\\] and I became super close about two years ago. we bonded over a toxic person who hurt us both in the same way. But everything shifted when I got a boyfriend. I've never been boy-crazy; I just happened to get into a relationship first, and she blew up over it. After that, Alice changed a lot and started to obsessively try and change to find a boyfriend. When my boyfriend and I eventually broke up, she completely dropped me and started calling me toxic, weird, fat, ugly, etc.   Now onto the friend I'm currently having issues with \\[I'll call her Natasha.\\] She has really attached herself to Alice. Natasha has had a rough family life and is usually staying at someone's house. I want to make it clear that I don't care that Natasha and Alice are friends. I was bummed at first because we all used to be close, but ive accepted that part. The problem now is that i've been feeling very lonely because Natasha is always with Alice.   This week I had a church conference Thursday and Friday, and that was what finally broke me. Natasha and Alice spent most of the time whispering to each other and going in and out of the bathroom crying because the guy Natasha is talking to his ex showed up and she had an issue with Natasha. Meanwhile I just sat there and watched, waiting to be including in the conversation. Newsflash that never happened. On the last day, I ended up having a breakdown because I felt useless and unwanted. It feels like the only time Natasha talks to me is when something is going wrong for her.   I don't need constant attention; I just want *some* effort in return. I also know i've been petty or rude at moments out of hurt, but whenever i try to talk to her she either walks away or talks over me changing the topic. Without Natasha I have no friends, and im scared of losing her too.   Now I don't know what to do. I just feel stupid and like i'm a bad friend, even though i've looked over the situation a hundred times and can't figure out what I actually am doing that is wrong besides trying to communicate my feelings.

{"selftext": "So this year has been rough for my family. My mother is a single parent of 4 including me (16f), my two brothers, and sister. I am the oldest of her children and been having to step up lately.  Earlier this year him and my mother had a fight about his screen time. It has always been 1 hour on vr for everyone, including me but he has always had trouble listening to this rule. He normally gets angry when I try to rush him off after he passes and hour and when I give him an extra 5 mintues he still won\u2019t get off when I tell him. At one point he started getting in before my mother was awake or sneaking on without asking. Him and my mother fought about how he needs to respect her rules or he can\u2019t bring use the headset or bring the one from his fathers house. My brothers dad doesn\u2019t care how much they go on electronics. My mom and their dad switch weeks with them on Sunday's each week. My youngest brother(11m) doesn\u2019t ever think the rules are unfair.  When my mother and brother had an argument about the rules he went to his dads the next day like normal but when it came the night to pick him up, his father told my mother that he wouldn\u2019t come, he didn\u2019t feel comfortable. My mom was asking for a reason since it was the week of spring break but my brothers dad said he was scared of when she left at night to see her friends (which she does once a month) even though I am here and capable of texting her if something\u2019s wrong and we have big dogs to protect us. All me and my siblings don\u2019t mind when she has left in the past since she returns before 12 and is never drunk or acting wild, she always checks in and makes sure everyone is okay beforehand.  My mother went to talk to him and see if he would come to our house or just talk but at their fathers house, his father tried making my mother talk to him through the screen door as him and his wife listened. Long story short he started getting persuaded to go with my mother but saw his father and closed up. Just so everyone knows, his father is a narcissist (professionally diagnosed) and him and his wife have been discreetly harassing my mother for months.   My mother was absolutely heart broken because she loves her children and does her best, the whole situation making her mental state much worse. For the next few months she only saw him during his sports games and she would cry after, clearly distressed and wanting to see him more. She and my brothers dad went to court. He tried to get full custody of one, key word, one of my brothers while supervised visits from my mom. He didn\u2019t talk about his other son which made it more suspicious. To shorten this, the judge told him he had to make my brothers come to our house. My brothers dad didnt exactly listen but after another court session my brother slowly started coming back.   Lately is the problem: My brother come to our house he acts like rules dont apply to him, he can eat junk food, doesnt have to do chores, and can just sit on his phone (that wasnt even supposed to be at our house but after an incident, it is). Now all hes been talking about are gifts and things he wants even though he doesnt do anything.   AITA for thinking he shouldn\u2019t have gifts after how he has impacted my mother and our family life?  Edit: Yes, I know I shouldn\u2019t be trying to parent but my mom has been giving into all his wishes he\u2019s asked for and after his fathers words towards her, hasn\u2019t been parenting him how she used to and how she does us. I haven\u2019t said anything yet but have been inching towards mentioning his behavior. I\u2019m taking all comments into consideration.", "post_id": "1odkxl5", "title": "AITA For telling my mother that my little brother (13) should not get many(if any) Christmas gifts this year.", "flair": "Asshole", "created_utc": 1761168082, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1odkxl5/aita_for_telling_my_mother_that_my_little_brother/", "downs": 0, "ups": 0, "score": 0}
