--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: I’m 20 years old and my mom has been an
addict for as long as i can remember. When i turned 18 she lost 1000 dollars a
month from her social security so it was a big change. I finally have a part
time job and make about 400 dollars each check (give or take bcz i don’t have a
set amount of hours.) My mom is demanding half of every check and i don’t want
to give it to her as she is an opioid addict. And quite frankly has never been
good with money. She already spends my 160 that i get on my food card every
month by ordering name brand groceries and so much meat and fruit that goes to
waste.   On top of that my friend who lives with us also pays her rent. My mom
never asked for me to pay rent until 1. she got her other pain meds cut off and
2. when my friend moved in and started paying her rent.   My mom also went
bankrupt for the second time a few months ago. She is already talking about
getting a loan for a car while her license is also suspended. I don’t feel comfy
paying a drug addict that i know very well half of my pay check.   I get that
she is in pain and has back issues and surgeries coming up and  she really does
want to get clean but im tired of seeing no progress and trusting her word. Not
even two days latter my friend gave her 400 she was coming to me saying she had
no money for cigs or umo fare.   She gets mad when i talk about moving and
saying why would i want to pay rent somewhere else and it’s gonna be more. I
know it will be more but giving the living situation i am in current, it’s not
worth a dime.   On top of it all i found out that i am pregnant so i really
can’t be living here and like this nor am i gonna be giving her money that i
will need more than ever to someone who doesn’t know how to budget and is just
gonna spend it on drugs. Every morning day and night i have to check on her
making sure shes not folded like a lawn chair. I can’t take care of a kid and
her.   Edit: In no way do I plan on staying here for very long especially if she
doesn’t start taking big steps very soon. My bf really wants to be here for me
and step up and get better job so we can get our own place. I am gonna ask my
boss to move up to full time so I can better prepare for my next steps aswell. I
know i am not responsible but I never needed to be before and I am gonna do
everything I can to make this life worth living for me and my kid.   And tbh all
i am seeing in the comments is stuff that i am fundamentally aware of, so it’s
more so just solidifying stuff i already know and will need to do. So everyone
telling me this is a bad situation and that i am irresponsible. I KNOW THAT,
that is why things need to change and I want to change them FAST.   At this
point it’s not even about the rent money or if i am the asshole. i just wanted
to hear everything i already know so i don’t feel like im just abandoning her
for no reason. It’s so unfair that i am the one that was left with this, so
proud of my sibling for getting out but god this just sucks all around.   I’ll
be sure to update yall when i make it out✌️

Opposing side:

While it’s understandable that the original poster feels overwhelmed and
concerned about their mother’s addiction and financial management, they are
ultimately responsible for their own choices and actions. By refusing to
contribute to the household expenses, they are abandoning their mother during a
difficult period, especially since she has supported them throughout their life.
Instead of seeking a way to balance their needs with helping their mother, the
original poster is choosing to turn away completely, which may further isolate
their mother and exacerbate her struggles. Supporting a parent in crisis, even
in small ways, can be crucial in encouraging recovery and demonstrating
compassion, rather than simply stepping back and leaving them to fend for
themselves.

The last YTA argument fails to consider the original poster's well-being and the
need to set boundaries in a challenging situation. The original poster's
decision to not contribute financially is not a rejection of their mother but
rather a necessary step to protect their own mental health and financial
stability. It’s essential to recognize that enabling a parent’s addiction can
lead to more harm than good. By refusing to support their mother in her
unhealthy habits, the original poster is taking a stand against enabling
behavior, which can ultimately encourage their mother to seek the help she
needs.   Additionally, the original poster may have already been impacted
significantly by their mother's addiction, and stepping back may be an act of
self-preservation. They are not at fault for prioritizing their own stability in
a challenging family dynamic.

compassion, rather than simply stepping back and leaving them to fend for
themselves.  **New Argument:** The original poster's refusal to contribute to
household expenses, despite their mother's struggles, reflects a lack of empathy
and responsibility. While setting boundaries is important, completely
withdrawing support could push the mother further into her addiction and
financial despair. By not taking any action to help, the original poster is
failing to consider the long-term consequences of their decision on both their
mother's situation and their own relationship with her. Compassionate
involvement, even if limited, could foster healing and open the door for
necessary conversations about her addiction.

The last YTA argument overlooks the complexity of the situation. The original
poster is not at fault for prioritizing their own mental health and well-being
in the face of their mother’s addiction. By refusing to contribute financially,
they are setting a necessary boundary to avoid enabling their mother’s harmful
behavior. This decision reflects a recognition that financial support could
inadvertently perpetuate their mother’s struggles with addiction rather than
help her seek recovery.   **New Argument:** Furthermore, the original poster’s
choice to withhold financial support can be seen as a proactive step towards
encouraging their mother to confront her addiction. Enabling behaviors, such as
providing money, could allow her to continue down a destructive path without
seeking the help she needs. By taking a stand, the original poster is not only
protecting themselves but also implicitly urging their mother to take
responsibility for her actions and seek assistance. In situations like this,
prioritizing one’s own health is not only justified but necessary for fostering
a healthier family dynamic in the long run.

The last YTA argument overlooks the essential need for the original poster to
prioritize their own mental health and well-being in the face of their mother’s
addiction. The refusal to contribute financially is a necessary boundary to
avoid enabling their mother's destructive behavior. Providing financial support
might inadvertently perpetuate her struggles rather than encourage recovery, and
the original poster’s decision reflects a thoughtful understanding of this
dynamic.  **New Argument:** Moreover, the original poster's choice to refrain
from financial contributions can serve as a catalyst for their mother to seek
help. By not enabling her addiction through financial support, the original
poster is prompting their mother to confront the reality of her situation and
consider the need for change. This tough love approach is often necessary in
addiction scenarios, as it can motivate individuals to seek the help they need.

may be crucial for both their own well-being and their mother’s potential path
to recovery.

The last YTA argument overlooks the crucial aspect of self-preservation in the
original poster's situation. By prioritizing their own mental health and well-
being, the original poster is taking a necessary step to avoid enabling their
mother's addiction. Refusing to contribute financially is not an act of
abandonment but rather a boundary that prevents further complicity in their
mother's destructive behavior. Supporting her financially may only perpetuate
her struggles, preventing her from confronting her situation.  **New Argument:**
Furthermore, the original poster's decision to withhold financial support can
serve as a wake-up call for their mother. By not enabling her through financial
means, they may be indirectly encouraging her to seek help and make positive
changes. This tough love approach can be critical in situations involving
addiction, as it can motivate individuals to take responsibility for their
actions instead of relying on others to support their harmful habits. In this

necessary choice that could ultimately facilitate both their own healing and
their mother’s potential recovery.
