=== QUERY ===
So I turned 21 this week - my birthday was on the 15th and we hosted a party on
the 18th. Th theme was 'dress as my favorite things' and I bought a karaoke
machine for the party. I live in a student area where people are frequently
hosting house parties, even then I made sure that our karaoke would not run past
11pm - as our council rules define quiet hours as between 11pm-7am. This was
something I made sure that the loud parts of the party would stay between.  At
about 8/9pm my friends started showing up we started doing our karaoke, at
10:05pm a neighbour I have never met before showed up at the door and was
slamming on both the doorbell and the door, I opened the door thinking it was a
friend. He then started screaming in my face about his babies not being able to
sleep (he was 70/80) before I could apologise he tried to force his way into our
house, stepping over our doormat - he only left when my boyfriend stepped in
front of me. I know we were being loud, louder than parties normally in this
area. we've handled our previous complaints with ease (the only ever other noise
complaint I have had is for the flat above mine and I made the complainers
banana bread to apologise).  We immediately turned off the music after he left -
however I did end up having a panic attack from the way he yelled at me, and
ended up calling 101 (the UK non emergency line) as I was shaken by the
experience and that's what my mum said to do.   I now have a meeting with a
police officer tomorrow, but don't know if I'm overacting or should have held
the party at all?

I recently got a new neighbor a few months ago. Overall I haven't had any
problems with them. They a young single mother with a small child. Then they
started this pattern of playing loud music during the day from time to time. Its
not bothersome but I had to ask them to lower it a bit today because I could
even here it in the hall. She was apologetic and turned it down. Then came last
night. She started blaring the music at 11am. By 3am, I had had enough. I went
up to her apartment and knocked on her door. She was entertaining a friend. They
never came to the door but I could hear them badmouthing me on the other side. I
went back to my apartment and emailed my landlord about the disturbance. I felt
like I could have handled things in a civil manner if she had just come to the
door instead of clearing saying, "I'm an adult and I can do what I want in my
own home" to her friend. I clearly heard it. AITA?

Title: AITAH For wanting to stay at my house during my sisters Halloween party

So my 16 y/o sister is throwing a Halloween party with 400+ people in my
backyard, which is about a half acre fenced off area of my parents yard.  She
threw her 16th here with 150 people and it was really controlled, we had friends
and family here as “security”, I was 38 weeks pregnant then and I stayed and
walked around the party handing out nibbly food for people to help with keeping
people from having a bit too much to drink and overdoing it.  Im planning on
being here again for this party, there’s more people coming for security and
we’re all confident it will be well controlled.  The thing is I am no longer
pregnant and have a 2 1/2 month old boy, that’s breastfed and really clingy.
I’m hoping to put him to bed by the time the party starts, but there’s also the
possibility of me just having him in the carrier-and I will not be in the fenced
off area where the party is, but on the other side of the fence with
family/friends supervising.  I’m also borrowing noise cancelling headphones from
my cousin with a 3 month old that they used to see monster trucks with their
toddler when their 3 month old was 2 weeks old.  The issue is that my partner,
the babies dad, thinks I’m putting the baby at risk. Ruining bubs routine (which
ive been really strict with lately and wanting my partner home to support the
routine )  He’s worried about Possibly ruining bubs hearing, and the dangers of
being surrounded by a bunch of drunk teens with a baby.  But in my defense, bubs
routine is going to be screwed anyway that night because we Cosleep and our
bedroom is not far from dj so neither of us will sleep (if I put him to bed it
will be in my parents house and opposite side, well away from the dj)  and I’m
not going to be in and around the people who are drunk, and I’m getting noise
canceling headphones as a precaution.  He’s been out at least twice a week
partying since bubs been born, and I have just been at home with zero sense of
freedom, and this is the first thing I’ve looked forward to in forever, I’m not
even partying but even just being around family and friends off to the side is
enough for me to look forward to it. I just want some sort of freedom ig?
AITAH??

Title: AITA for crashing my roommates „party“?

This morning my boyfriend and I were sleeping at my place, a shared apartment.
At 6AM we get woken up by my roommate who came home from clubbing (this roommate
has been living with us for 2 months). She came home with 3 other people and
they were being very loud (laughing hysterically, screaming, slamming doors). I
texted our group chat and ironically asked if they could be any louder. I got no
reply and they didn’t turn the volume down. I get up and scream at my roommate
to turn it down because everyone is trying to sleep. She laughs in my face and
says they will do so. But they didn’t. I fell asleep for a little bit when i
woke up at 7AM because of loud noises. I turn to my boyfriend and we both
realize what they are doing. Her friend and a guy were having fun in the kitchen
and my roommate and a guy had fun in her room. We immediately turn on some music
so we don’t have to hear them. My boyfriend went up to go to the toilet and the
kitchen door was wide open. After that they all went into the roommate’s room.
We thought it was over so we turned the music off. After a few minutes i get up
to go to the toilet and they were going at it again (once again very loudly).
I’ve had enough and banged on her door and yelled at her and kicked the 2 guys
out. I was mad and screamed at her asking what’s going on with her and how she
thinks that that is okay. She just laughed in my face hysterically. I told her
to clean the whole kitchen which she’s only done after i told her 5 times. She
told me that she didn’t get why i was so mad and what she did wrong. AITA?

Title: AITA for complaining about neighbors loud video games

I have two young kiddos and live in a bottom floor apartment of a complex. We
can be loud sometimes during the day but they are in bed by 8 pm. They sleep
through the night and don't make noise until they wake up around 6 am. We keep
it as quiet as possible until quiet hours are over . Inevitably sometimes there
is crying or playing through out the day. My upstairs neighbors however play
video games with alot of bass at all hours of the day/night. I've awoken at all
hours of the night from the noise, most recently at 2 am. While we are not the
quietest of neighbors, we respect the quiet time hours. Once I filed a complaint
with the property management, they made similar claims. I am genuinely concerned
my kids and I will be kicked out for making noise during the day. Am I the
asshole for reporting them?

Title: AITA for not wanting to share my birthday?

This is a weird one and idk if i should just agree to clear the air.   My (20F)
birthday is coming up soon and bc ill be turning 21 my parents want to do
something special. Theyve hired a party bus for me and friends for the night so
we can drink, hang out and do karaoke before properly going out to celebrate
that night. Im very excited and have invited my group of friends. However, bc
its a party bus there is a limit of how many ppl i can invite (15 max, me
included) so I invited my closest 15 friends in the group (theres abt 20-25 of
us altogether). It sucked not being able to invite the whole group but im able
to have everyone id want to be there so its not a huge issue.  However, one of
the girls in the group- Emily 20F- is born the day after me. Her and I are not
very close and typically only see each other in large group hang outs- never 1
on 1. She was not invited as part of the 15 friends as we are not that close,
however she (and the rest of the group) is invited to join us on the night out.
Nobody else in the group has had an issue with this arrangement and have been
understanding that there’s a limit on how many ppl can come and they all seem to
be aware that it isnt something i have against them.  Emily however has
apparently had an issue with not being invited. I have texted her multiple times
now to check in and ask if were okay, to which she has told me shes fine and its
a non-issue. But a couple of my friends have told me shes been ranting and
complaining abt not being invited.   She sent me a text a couple days ago saying
some people might not be able to join me to celebrate bc she wants to celebrate
her birthday a day early (so on my birthday). I have checked with the group and
everyone i invited has confirmed they will be spending my birthday with me.
This has upset her even more as now shes been complaining nobody will be
celebrating with her (even though we have all agreed to join her and everyone
after the party bus). She has said she wants to book a private room at 10pm
which we all have to be there for or we cant join her (the party bus doesnt end
till 11) and has said now began asking if we cant just ‘share’ my birthday.  She
called me today asking if she can join us on the bus and we do a ‘shared
birthday party’. I told her no as that would involve uninviting one of my
friends who I want to be there, and also my parents have paid for this bus- she
hasn’t contributed anything.   After the call I had a couple messages from other
friends not invited saying if we shared my birthday it would save drama. But its
my birthday? I dont understand why she HAS to celebrate on my birthday (mine is
on a Friday, her is a Saturday) so both nights will be good to celebrate and we
will be w her at midnight to congratulate her turning 21 too.  Should I have
just said yes and saved any drama? I dont want this to ruin our birthdays…
Edit: I should mention Im from the UK so we can both drink
