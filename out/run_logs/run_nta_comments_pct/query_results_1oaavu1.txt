=== QUERY ===
Our bins are collected on a Tuesday morning, so we usually put them out on a
Monday evening. This is to avoid the hassle of putting them out in the morning
or risk missing them being collected in case the binmen come early.   We forgot
to put the bin out until I remembered at about 11pm. I brought our bin out and
went back in. Bin got collected. Happy days.  My neighbour came up to me and got
angry at me because I brought the bin out too late and that it was too noisy
when they were trying to sleep. I apologised several times for this and told
them that it won't happen again, but they just kept giving out about it and then
walked back into their house without accepting it or even acknowledging it.  I
went back inside, explained what happened to my fiancee. They think that:  1.
They are being unreasonable telling us when we can and can't take our bin out.
2. That they were rude to walk away from me without acknowledging my apology. 3.
That if they didn't want to hear outside noises that they shouldn't keep their
bedroom windows open (they keep their bedroom window open every night)  I'll be
more considerate about this going forward, either making sure to bring the bin
out earlier or carrying the bin to the collection point so as to avoid the
wheels making any noise, but them getting angry about it to me has taken me back
a bit, and I feel like she doesn't like us anymore.  Just wondering what you
guys think?

I usually work pretty late and unfortunately, I worked late shit last night and
now I’m opening this morning not a big deal however my neighbor is constantly
playing incredibly loud music very early in the morning so this morning, I went
outside to ask him to stop it when I got to his car there was nobody in it so I
waited for about two minutes and when no one came outside, I opened the door to
his car and turn the music off myself. They came outside the second I was
closing his door they didn’t seem upset, but I explained to them that I worked
pretty late and then music wakes me up almost every morning. They said they
wouldn’t do it again, but I feel like an asshole for going in their car. I
probably could’ve handled it differently, but it was. 7:50 in the morning and
I’m tired

Title: AITA For Asking Neighbor to not play music at 3am?

I recently got a new neighbor a few months ago. Overall I haven't had any
problems with them. They a young single mother with a small child. Then they
started this pattern of playing loud music during the day from time to time. Its
not bothersome but I had to ask them to lower it a bit today because I could
even here it in the hall. She was apologetic and turned it down. Then came last
night. She started blaring the music at 11am. By 3am, I had had enough. I went
up to her apartment and knocked on her door. She was entertaining a friend. They
never came to the door but I could hear them badmouthing me on the other side. I
went back to my apartment and emailed my landlord about the disturbance. I felt
like I could have handled things in a civil manner if she had just come to the
door instead of clearing saying, "I'm an adult and I can do what I want in my
own home" to her friend. I clearly heard it. AITA?

Title: AITA for walking around my room at night?

Tonight my downstairs housemate (28f) texted me (25f) to be quiet because she
could hear me 'doing laps around my room or moving furniture' at 10:40pm.
Problem is, I wasn't doing that.   I tend to go to bed at 11, so at 10:30-45ish
I get ready for bed by putting on my pajamas, walking to the bathroom to brush
my teeth, walking back, doing skincare, generally just being upright and moving
around the room. At most the amount of 'furniture moved' is me opening and
closing the wardrobe door.   Tonight I happened to be listening to a podcast
while I was doing it, so I know for a fact I had only been 'making noise' for
around 12 minutes before she texted me.   Personally I don't think it's
unreasonable to spend 10-15 minutes every night getting ready for bed. I will
also say that this 10-15 minutes is the only time I'm moving around my room at
all in the evening. I spend the entire rest of the time just sat being quiet. I
always listen to music and podcasts with headphones. I can for sure understand
that it must be annoying to hear footsteps when you're trying to sleep but I
personally think that before 11pm is kind of fair game?   Anyway, I replied to
her saying sorry and I genuinely felt really bad about it for a while but the
more I think about it the more I don't think I'm in the wrong? But am I just
really misjudging this and it's totally inappropriate to make noise in a share
house after 10pm? AITA?  Edit: Lots of people are speculating about the floor!
It's carpeted, but the carpet is thin and probably really old so might not be
helping much. Also, I always either wear slippers or socks indoors and tonight
was wearing slippers.

Title: AITA for complaining about neighbors loud video games

I have two young kiddos and live in a bottom floor apartment of a complex. We
can be loud sometimes during the day but they are in bed by 8 pm. They sleep
through the night and don't make noise until they wake up around 6 am. We keep
it as quiet as possible until quiet hours are over . Inevitably sometimes there
is crying or playing through out the day. My upstairs neighbors however play
video games with alot of bass at all hours of the day/night. I've awoken at all
hours of the night from the noise, most recently at 2 am. While we are not the
quietest of neighbors, we respect the quiet time hours. Once I filed a complaint
with the property management, they made similar claims. I am genuinely concerned
my kids and I will be kicked out for making noise during the day. Am I the
asshole for reporting them?

Title: AITA for not wanting my roommate's boyfriend in our home unsupervised?
Score: 249
Post ID: 1ohsysf

I (f27) share an apartment with my friend (f25). She has been dating her
boyfriend since February. In the beginning he would occasionally stay over
(one/two nights per week) and she would sleep at his place once/twice per week.
This summer they went on vacation together and they have been inseparable ever
since. Having dinner and spending the night together every single night, 50/50
at our place and his place (he owns a studio by himself about a 45 minute drive
away). There is nothing in our lease about guests or key-usage by third parties.
After the summer she told me she had given him spare keys because he finishes
work a little bit earlier than she does, and it would be more practical if he
can come here without having to wait 30 minutes. I was not amused to say the
least, I had a conversation with her she has to communicate such things
beforehand and that it really wasn't cool because they were actually my keys
(she thought they were spare keys for general usage). We agreed it was alright
if he had keys for those 30 minutes now and then if it would be more practical
to let himself in, but that I didn't want him unattended for prolonged periods
of time because he is still a guest after all.  Fast forward to today, my
roommate leaves to go to the gym, and 5 minutes later I hear him come into our
home and start cooking. After a good 2 hours I come into the living room and
notice my roommate still hasn't returned. It was not the first time, so I felt
like I was well within my right to set this boundary again. I calmly asked him
if he was aware of the agreements about the keys, to which he said he wasn't. In
the middle of that conversation my roommate returns. I calmly explained to the
two of them we made clear agreements, but that this was really pushing my limits
and that I felt uncomfortable, 2 hours of him being here while she is out at the
gym is not the 30 minutes that would be more practical with work-schedules. It
is not what we agreed upon, I feel uncomfortable, please come up with a
solution, that's it. All explained very calmly, no raised voice, no unnecessary
accusing, no derailing from the topic.   The two of them reacted quite vicious,
that she wasn't aware I would take our agreement so literally, that they didn't
see another solution (mind you, they made it work for 5 months before he had
keys), that they really didn't see the problem, that he always stayed in her
room if he was here so early (he wouldn't have to stay in her room for 2 hours
if they would stick to the agreements). Then they flipped the script on me, what
I think would be a good solution, and how I would be if I had a boyfriend. I
calmly explained it is their relationship and their schedules, they should
arrange something that fits all of our boundaries accordingly. They finished by
saying I am unreasonable for bringing it up and that they for sure would get
back to me.   It has left quite a sour aftertaste and now I'm not sure anymore
if I'm not overreacting...
