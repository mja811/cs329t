{"selftext": "I recently got a new neighbor a few months ago. Overall I haven't had any problems with them. They a young single mother with a small child. Then they started this pattern of playing loud music during the day from time to time. Its not bothersome but I had to ask them to lower it a bit today because I could even here it in the hall. She was apologetic and turned it down. Then came last night. She started blaring the music at 11am. By 3am, I had had enough. I went up to her apartment and knocked on her door. She was entertaining a friend. They never came to the door but I could hear them badmouthing me on the other side. I went back to my apartment and emailed my landlord about the disturbance. I felt like I could have handled things in a civil manner if she had just come to the door instead of clearing saying, \"I'm an adult and I can do what I want in my own home\" to her friend. I clearly heard it.

{"selftext": "So my 16 y/o sister is throwing a Halloween party with 400+ people in my backyard, which is about a half acre fenced off area of my parents yard.  She threw her 16th here with 150 people and it was really controlled, we had friends and family here as \u201csecurity\u201d, I was 38 weeks pregnant then and I stayed and walked around the party handing out nibbly food for people to help with keeping people from having a bit too much to drink and overdoing it.  Im planning on being here again for this party, there\u2019s more people coming for security and we\u2019re all confident it will be well controlled.  The thing is I am no longer pregnant and have a 2 1/2 month old boy, that\u2019s breastfed and really clingy.  I\u2019m hoping to put him to bed by the time the party starts, but there\u2019s also the possibility of me just having him in the carrier-and I will not be in the fenced off area where the party is, but on the other side of the fence with family/friends supervising.  I\u2019m also borrowing noise cancelling headphones from my cousin with a 3 month old that they used to see monster trucks with their toddler when their 3 month old was 2 weeks old.  The issue is that my partner, the babies dad, thinks I\u2019m putting the baby at risk. Ruining bubs routine (which ive been really strict with lately and wanting my partner home to support the routine )  He\u2019s worried about Possibly ruining bubs hearing, and the dangers of being surrounded by a bunch of drunk teens with a baby.  But in my defense, bubs routine is going to be screwed anyway that night because we Cosleep and our bedroom is not far from dj so neither of us will sleep (if I put him to bed it will be in my parents house and opposite side, well away from the dj)  and I\u2019m not going to be in and around the people who are drunk, and I\u2019m getting noise canceling headphones as a precaution.  He\u2019s been out at least twice a week partying since bubs been born, and I have just been at home with zero sense of freedom, and this is the first thing I\u2019ve looked forward to in forever, I\u2019m not even partying but even just being around family and friends off to the side is enough for me to look forward to it.

{"selftext": "This morning my boyfriend and I were sleeping at my place, a shared apartment. At 6AM we get woken up by my roommate who came home from clubbing (this roommate has been living with us for 2 months). She came home with 3 other people and they were being very loud (laughing hysterically, screaming, slamming doors). I texted our group chat and ironically asked if they could be any louder. I got no reply and they didn\u2019t turn the volume down. I get up and scream at my roommate to turn it down because everyone is trying to sleep. She laughs in my face and says they will do so. But they didn\u2019t. I fell asleep for a little bit when i woke up at 7AM because of loud noises. I turn to my boyfriend and we both realize what they are doing. Her friend and a guy were having fun in the kitchen and my roommate and a guy had fun in her room. We immediately turn on some music so we don\u2019t have to hear them. My boyfriend went up to go to the toilet and the kitchen door was wide open. After that they all went into the roommate\u2019s room. We thought it was over so we turned the music off. After a few minutes i get up to go to the toilet and they were going at it again (once again very loudly). I\u2019ve had enough and banged on her door and yelled at her and kicked the 2 guys out. I was mad and screamed at her asking what\u2019s going on with her and how she thinks that that is okay. She just laughed in my face hysterically. I told her to clean the whole kitchen which she\u2019s only done after i told her 5 times. She told me that she didn\u2019t get why i was so mad and what she did wrong.

{"selftext": "I have two young kiddos and live in a bottom floor apartment of a complex. We can be loud sometimes during the day but they are in bed by 8 pm. They sleep through the night and don't make noise until they wake up around 6 am. We keep it as quiet as possible until quiet hours are over . Inevitably sometimes there is crying or playing through out the day. My upstairs neighbors however play video games with alot of bass at all hours of the day/night. I've awoken at all hours of the night from the noise, most recently at 2 am. While we are not the quietest of neighbors, we respect the quiet time hours. Once I filed a complaint with the property management, they made similar claims. I am genuinely concerned my kids and I will be kicked out for making noise during the day.

{"selftext": "This is a weird one and idk if i should just agree to clear the air.   My (20F) birthday is coming up soon and bc ill be turning 21 my parents want to do something special. Theyve hired a party bus for me and friends for the night so we can drink, hang out and do karaoke before properly going out to celebrate that night. Im very excited and have invited my group of friends. However, bc its a party bus there is a limit of how many ppl i can invite (15 max, me included) so I invited my closest 15 friends in the group (theres abt 20-25 of us altogether). It sucked not being able to invite the whole group but im able to have everyone id want to be there so its not a huge issue.  However, one of the girls in the group- Emily 20F- is born the day after me. Her and I are not very close and typically only see each other in large group hang outs- never 1 on 1. She was not invited as part of the 15 friends as we are not that close, however she (and the rest of the group) is invited to join us on the night out. Nobody else in the group has had an issue with this arrangement and have been understanding that there\u2019s a limit on how many ppl can come and they all seem to be aware that it isnt something i have against them.  Emily however has apparently had an issue with not being invited. I have texted her multiple times now to check in and ask if were okay, to which she has told me shes fine and its a non-issue. But a couple of my friends have told me shes been ranting and complaining abt not being invited.   She sent me a text a couple days ago saying some people might not be able to join me to celebrate bc she wants to celebrate her birthday a day early (so on my birthday). I have checked with the group and everyone i invited has confirmed they will be spending my birthday with me.   This has upset her even more as now shes been complaining nobody will be celebrating with her (even though we have all agreed to join her and everyone after the party bus). She has said she wants to book a private room at 10pm which we all have to be there for or we cant join her (the party bus doesnt end till 11) and has said now began asking if we cant just \u2018share\u2019 my birthday.  She called me today asking if she can join us on the bus and we do a \u2018shared birthday party\u2019. I told her no as that would involve uninviting one of my friends who I want to be there, and also my parents have paid for this bus- she hasn\u2019t contributed anything.   After the call I had a couple messages from other friends not invited saying if we shared my birthday it would save drama. But its my birthday? I dont understand why she HAS to celebrate on my birthday (mine is on a Friday, her is a Saturday) so both nights will be good to celebrate and we will be w her at midnight to congratulate her turning 21 too.  Should I have just said yes and saved any drama? I dont want this to ruin our birthdays\u2026  Edit: I should mention Im from the UK so we can both drink", "post_id": "1oe6zak", "title": "AITA for not wanting to share my birthday?", "flair": "Not the A-hole", "created_utc": 1761234799, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oe6zak/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_my_birthday/", "downs": 0, "ups": 239, "score": 239}
