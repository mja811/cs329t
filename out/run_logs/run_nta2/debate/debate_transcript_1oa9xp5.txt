--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: My bf &amp; I recently moved in
together&amp; are having a bonfire tn with a few of his friends. His ex roommate
has been dating this girl on&amp;off the past year or so. Ive had minimal
interactions w her but everytime ive seen her in person she says nothing to me
unless I say hi first then shell say hi. Shes told my bfs roommate from the get
go that shes worried he wants to date me&amp;that im flirting w him. Both my
bf&amp; his room mate know this isnt true. My bf and I have a really good
relationship&amp; theres never been attraction or flirtation between me&amp;his
room mate or any1 else for that matter  Room mates gf has messaged me several
times on fb telling me she knows im attracted to her bf &amp; that I exclude her
by not saying hi when I see her(shes referencing a time when she didnt hear me
say hi&amp; found it rude). She doesnt believe me or my bf when we tell her im
not attracted to her bf. She also asked me to stop talking to her bf &amp; i
told her im not going to ignore him when im at my bfs house &amp; his rm-mate
starts talking to both of us.   She even snooped so far back on my fb &amp;
found a post I shared 10 or so years ago &amp; sent it to her bf w no context,
asking him if he liked it&amp;when he said yeah she told him i had posted it(It
wasnt even my original post, i just shared smthing). Her mssges&amp;stalking my
fb were so anxiety inducing at one point I blocked her. She then found me on
insta&amp;sent me a message telling me i was petty for blocking her,which I
didnt even notice until she screen shot it, sent it to my bf&amp;then blocked
him I unblocked her cause I felt bad and to explain why id blocked her in the
first place Also she wont say a single thing to me in person &amp;ive invited
her to hang w us several times but she never comes  Recently she &amp;her bf
broke up. Its happened a couple times &amp; im not super close w my bfs rm-mate
so I didnt think much of it until she sent me a message on fb telling me they
broke up&amp; asking me if I could find him someone else to date. This is like
within a week of them breaking up. I found this really weird and it made me even
more anxious. I responded by telling her my bf, who was still living w him,
could check on him&amp; left it at that  That brings us to the present. my bf
moved in last week &amp; we invited his ex room mate over for this bon fire. I
didnt think the gf would be a problem bc they arent 2gether but today he asked
if she could come with. my bf &amp; I both said no. He said this made her sad
&amp; he might not come  I really dont want her at my hosue. Shes made me so
anxious &amp; it honestly makes me feel crazy that she even asked to come w
after everything My bf is more chill abt her coming over but hes also supportive
of me not wanting to see her  AITA? Should I let her come over? I feel bad that
my bfs friend isnt gonna come now &amp; im worried shes gonna isolate him from
his friends esp if hes living alone now

Opposing side:

The original poster is in the wrong because they are allowing their personal
discomfort and anxiety about the girlfriend to dictate who can attend a social
gathering at their home, which is unfair to both their boyfriend's friend and
the girlfriend herself. Instead of fostering an inclusive environment, they are
creating division and potentially jeopardizing their boyfriend's friendships. By
refusing to allow her to come simply because of past interactions, they are
being controlling and not making an effort to resolve the situation in a mature
manner. It's important to prioritize open communication and inclusivity,
especially when it comes to social gatherings that involve mutual friends.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the previous argument suggests that the
original poster (OP) is being controlling by not wanting the girlfriend at their
home, it's essential to recognize that the OP is prioritizing their own mental
health and comfort. Hosting a gathering should not come at the expense of the
host's well-being. If the OP feels anxious or uncomfortable around the
girlfriend due to past experiences, it is entirely reasonable for them to set
boundaries to protect their own emotional state.  A new concise argument for the
OP not being at fault: The OP is not at fault because they are exercising their
right to create a safe and comfortable environment in their own home. Everyone
has the right to determine who they feel comfortable hosting, especially when
past interactions have led to anxiety. Setting boundaries is a healthy way to
manage personal relationships, and the OP is simply asserting their needs in a
situation that could otherwise lead to distress.

Refuting the last NTA argument: While the argument emphasizes the OP's right to
create a comfortable environment in their home, it overlooks the importance of
fostering healthy relationships and communication. By refusing to invite the
girlfriend, the OP is not only risking their boyfriend's friendships but also
missing an opportunity to address any issues directly. Instead of setting a
boundary, the OP is creating unnecessary division and conflict in their social
circle, which can ultimately lead to resentment and isolation.  A new concise
argument for the author being at fault: The OP is at fault because they are
prioritizing their discomfort over the well-being of their boyfriend and his
friends. By excluding the girlfriend from social events without attempting to
resolve past issues, the OP is not only being unfair to her but also undermining
their relationship with their boyfriend. Healthy relationships require
compromise and understanding, and the OP's unwillingness to engage with the
girlfriend reflects a lack of maturity and empathy.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the previous argument suggests that the
original poster (OP) is risking their boyfriend's friendships by not inviting
the girlfriend, it fails to consider that the OP's discomfort stems from genuine
past issues that have affected their mental health. By setting a boundary
regarding who can attend their home, the OP is prioritizing their emotional
well-being, which is essential in maintaining healthy relationships. It’s not
about excluding the girlfriend for no reason; it’s about protecting oneself from
a situation that has previously caused distress.  A new concise argument for the
OP not being at fault: The OP is not at fault because they are taking a
necessary step to protect their mental health in a situation that has
historically caused them anxiety. It is their right to create a safe space in
their own home, especially when past experiences have led them to feel
uncomfortable. The OP's decision to exclude the girlfriend is a valid expression
of their needs and boundaries, which is crucial for maintaining their emotional
well-being.

Refuting the last NTA argument: While the last argument emphasizes the OP's
right to protect their emotional well-being, it overlooks the importance of
fostering healthy relationships and communication. By excluding the girlfriend
without attempting to resolve any issues directly, the OP is not only risking
their boyfriend's friendships but also creating unnecessary drama. Healthy
relationships thrive on open dialogue and compromise, and the OP's refusal to
include the girlfriend may reflect a lack of willingness to engage in
constructive communication.  A new concise argument for the author being at
fault: The OP is at fault because they are allowing their personal discomfort to
dictate the dynamics of their social circle, which can harm both their boyfriend
and the girlfriend. Instead of seeking to address past issues collaboratively or
allowing for the possibility of change, the OP is choosing to isolate the
girlfriend, which can lead to resentment and further complications in their
relationships. It's essential to prioritize not only personal comfort but also
the health of the broader social environment.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the last argument highlights the
importance of fostering healthy relationships and communication, it fails to
recognize that the OP’s discomfort is a valid concern rooted in past
experiences. The OP is not simply excluding the girlfriend out of spite; they
are protecting their mental health by establishing boundaries that reflect their
emotional needs. Ignoring personal boundaries can lead to greater conflict and
distress, making it crucial for the OP to prioritize their well-being.  A new
concise argument for the OP not being at fault: The OP is not at fault because
they are exercising their right to set boundaries in their own home based on
past negative experiences. Mental health is paramount, and the OP's decision to
exclude the girlfriend from social gatherings is a proactive measure to ensure
their comfort and safety. It is entirely reasonable for individuals to create a
space that aligns with their emotional needs, especially when previous
interactions have caused anxiety.

Refuting the last NTA argument: While the previous argument emphasizes the
importance of setting boundaries for mental health, it neglects to consider the
broader implications of the OP's actions on their relationships. By excluding
the girlfriend from social gatherings without seeking resolution, the OP is not
only risking their boyfriend's friendships but also perpetuating a cycle of
negativity and division. Healthy relationships require proactive communication
and a willingness to engage with others, rather than isolating oneself from
potential conflicts.  A new concise argument for the author being at fault: The
OP is at fault because they are prioritizing their discomfort over the
opportunity for growth and reconciliation within their social circle. By
refusing to invite the girlfriend, the OP is not only alienating her but also
undermining their boyfriend's relationships. Rather than addressing their
feelings directly and fostering a more inclusive environment, the OP is choosing
to create unnecessary barriers that could lead to resentment and conflict in the
future. This behavior reflects a lack of maturity and an unwillingness to engage
with the complexities of interpersonal relationships.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the previous response highlights the
importance of growth and reconciliation in relationships, it fails to
acknowledge that the OP's discomfort is a legitimate concern based on past
interactions that have caused them distress. The OP is not simply avoiding
conflict; they are taking necessary steps to protect their mental health in a
situation that has previously impacted them negatively. This boundary-setting is
an important part of self-care and emotional well-being.  A new concise argument
for the OP not being at fault: The OP is not at fault because they are
prioritizing their emotional safety in a potentially uncomfortable situation. It
is entirely reasonable for someone to choose not to invite individuals into
their home who have previously caused them distress. By establishing this
boundary, the OP is ensuring they can maintain their peace of mind, which is
crucial for a healthy host-guest dynamic. Ultimately, everyone has the right to
create a safe environment for themselves, especially in their own space.

Refuting the last NTA argument: While the emphasis on prioritizing emotional
safety is valid, it overlooks the responsibility that comes with relationships.
The OP’s choice to exclude the girlfriend without seeking any resolution or
dialogue demonstrates a lack of willingness to engage constructively. Instead of
addressing their discomfort through communication, the OP is creating an
exclusionary environment that could harm both their relationship with their
boyfriend and their broader social dynamic.  A new concise argument for the
author being at fault: The OP is at fault because they are failing to
demonstrate maturity and empathy by not allowing the opportunity for
reconciliation. By excluding the girlfriend from gatherings, the OP is not only
dismissing their boyfriend’s friendships but also missing a chance to foster
understanding and potentially improve their own feelings about her. Navigating
interpersonal relationships requires effort and the willingness to face
discomfort, and the OP’s avoidance is detrimental to the growth of both their
relationship and their social circle.

Refuting the last NTA argument: While the previous argument emphasizes the
importance of emotional safety, it overlooks the potential for personal growth
through confronting uncomfortable situations. The OP’s choice to exclude the
girlfriend shows a reluctance to engage in meaningful dialogue that could help
resolve past issues. Instead of fostering understanding and reconciliation, the
OP is choosing to isolate themselves and their boyfriend from potential positive
interactions, which can ultimately harm their relationship and social dynamics.
A new concise argument for the author being at fault: The OP is at fault because
they are prioritizing their discomfort over the opportunity to build
relationships and foster inclusivity. By excluding the girlfriend from social
events, the OP is not only alienating her but also disregarding their
boyfriend’s feelings and friendships. This refusal to engage with the girlfriend
can breed resentment and misunderstandings, ultimately undermining the potential
for a more harmonious social environment. Healthy relationships require
communication and effort, and the OP's avoidance may prevent growth and
resolution.

### Conclusion Both sides present valid points, but the arguments for YTA
