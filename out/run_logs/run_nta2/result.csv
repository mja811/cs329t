1oad7wt,AITA for telling my mom her boyfriend isn't welcome to events anymore?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oad7wt/aita_for_telling_my_mom_her_boyfriend_isnt/,NTA,YTA,False,"I, (28F) have recently told my mother her I will no longer be going out to see her at her home, where she and her boyfriend, let's call him Fred, live, and he is no longer welcome to come here under any circumstance. For context, my mom lives about an hour away, and with work schedules and all, we don't see each other too often to start. Now, she and ""Fred"", have been together for about 6 years, and have lived together for about 5, and she made the move out of town to be with him. Since myself and my younger brother were already grown and out of the house already, and she has been seeing him for a year already, they were making plans to move in together, but since his kids were younger, I believe 18 and 16 at the time, it made sense for her to move out there. We were all fond of Fred when she had introduced him, and after her long history with abusive relationships, he seemed like a great change, and we were happy for her. My mom, relocating, didn't know anyone out there other than Fred and his family, and since relocating had to start a new job. Everything seemed fine until fast forward a year or so when his behavior started to change. He is constantly accusing her of cheating (despite never doing so), always questioning her whereabouts, and even makes comments about her weight. So over the years, I would get phone calls of her crying, and saying how she can't do it anymore. Her being my mother, I always tried to help, and even offered for her to stay with me and my family until she found something for herself. But, he'd apologize , and all was forgiven. This has happened about a dozen times in the last 5 years, and always she forgives him, and everything is all dandy again.  Now, fast forward to a few weeks ago. I got one of these phone calls, again, and so did my brother. This time seemed like it was it. So myself, brother, sister in-law and my husband were making plans to get her out and to set her up back here in our town. But low and behold, two days later, he apologized and everything was forgiven, again. So my brother and I had said enough was enough, and if she was ever serious about leaving, we will 100% be there for her, and she is always welcome here to visit, but is no longer welcome, since we cannot pretend to fake nice to a man who treats our mother like garbage. I also have two young children who have started to ask why he says mean things to their grandma, and said I don't want her to model that type of relationship to them. But she has sense said I'm being, quote ""immature, mean, and that is uncalled for since he's 'trying"""", and is telling other family members I'm trying to cut her out, when I have said she is still always welcome. AITA for saying he cannot come anymore? Or should I just bare it for the sake of not losing my mother and the relationship with her grandkids?",,"The original poster is the asshole because, despite her mother's choices, she is attempting to control her mother's relationship and lifestyle in a way that could further alienate her. Instead of fostering a supportive environment, she is creating ultimatums that may push her mother away, ultimately risking their relationship. The OP should focus on providing emotional support and encouragement for her mother to make healthy choices rather than dictating who can or cannot be part of her life. This approach could lead to resentment and conflict, making it less likely for her mother to feel safe to confide in her about her struggles.

In response to the YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster's intentions stem from concern for her mother's well-being rather than a desire to control her life. The OP is not at fault for wanting to protect her mother from potential harm, especially if she perceives that the mother's partner may be a negative influence. 

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault is that setting boundaries is a crucial aspect of caring for loved ones. The OP is attempting to establish healthy limits that prioritize her mother's mental and emotional health. By expressing her concerns and advocating for her mother's well-being, the OP is fulfilling her responsibility as a caring daughter, not as a controlling figure. This proactive approach can foster a more open dialogue, ultimately leading to a more supportive relationship.The original poster is at fault because, despite her good intentions, she is imposing her own judgments and decisions on her mother rather than respecting her autonomy as an adult. The OP's approach of issuing ultimatums can create a rift in their relationship, as it makes her mother feel cornered and judged instead of supported. Instead of fostering a healthy dialogue about concerns, the OP's method could push her mother to be defensive and less likely to share her feelings or experiences. A more empathetic and understanding approach would likely yield better results, showing that the OP is prioritizing her mother's emotional well-being over her own need to control the situation.

Furthermore, the OP's insistence on dictating her mother's relationship choices could inadvertently reinforce the very behaviors she is trying to change, as it may lead her mother to cling to those relationships out of rebellion or a sense of isolation. This ultimately undermines the OP's goal of ensuring her mother's happiness and health.

In response to the YTA argument, it's essential to highlight that the original poster's intentions are rooted in genuine concern for her mother's well-being. While the OP's approach may seem controlling, it stems from a place of love and a desire to protect her mother from potential harm. 

A new argument supporting the OP’s position is that advocating for a loved one's health and safety is not only reasonable but necessary. The OP is trying to prevent her mother from possibly entering a harmful situation with an unsuitable partner. In this context, the OP’s actions can be seen as a protective measure rather than an attempt to dominate her mother’s choices. By expressing her concerns and urging her mother to reconsider her relationship, the OP is fulfilling her role as a caring daughter who wants the best for her mother, emphasizing that sometimes tough conversations are needed for the sake of one’s health and happiness.The original poster is at fault because, despite her intentions to protect her mother, she is adopting a controlling stance that undermines her mother's autonomy. By setting ultimatums regarding her mother's relationships, the OP risks creating an adversarial dynamic that could damage their bond rather than strengthen it. This approach may lead her mother to feel judged and resentful, causing her to withdraw or rebel rather than engage in an open conversation about her choices.

Additionally, the OP's insistence on dictating her mother's social interactions could backfire by alienating her mother and making her more likely to resist any advice or support. Instead of fostering a nurturing environment, the OP's method may inadvertently push her mother closer to the very influences she seeks to protect her from. A more constructive approach would focus on dialogue and support, respecting her mother's agency while expressing genuine concern for her well-being.

In response to the last YTA argument, it's crucial to emphasize that the original poster's actions stem from a place of genuine concern and care for her mother's well-being. The OP is not at fault for wanting to ensure her mother is in a healthy and supportive environment, especially if she has valid reasons to believe that the mother's partner may be detrimental to her mental or emotional health.

A new argument supporting the OP is that, as a loving daughter, it is her responsibility to voice concerns when she believes her mother's choices may lead to harm. Setting boundaries can be a crucial aspect of protecting loved ones, and the OP's intentions are grounded in a desire to help rather than control. By expressing her worries, the OP is fostering a dialogue that could ultimately lead to better outcomes for her mother, encouraging her to reflect on her relationships and make choices that truly serve her best interests. This proactive stance is not only understandable but necessary in situations where a loved one may be vulnerable.The original poster is at fault because, despite her good intentions, she is approaching the situation in a way that undermines her mother's autonomy and could ultimately damage their relationship. By issuing ultimatums about her mother’s relationships, the OP is positioning herself as a gatekeeper, which can create resentment and defensiveness. This controlling dynamic can push her mother away instead of fostering a supportive environment where open communication is encouraged.

Additionally, the OP's insistence on dictating her mother’s choices can lead to increased tension and may even cause her mother to cling to the very relationships the OP is concerned about. Instead of fostering understanding, the OP's method risks alienating her mother, making her less likely to seek support or share her feelings. A more effective approach would involve expressing concern while respecting her mother’s right to make her own choices, which would likely lead to a healthier dialogue and a more constructive relationship.

In response to the last YTA argument, it’s important to recognize that the original poster's actions are motivated by genuine concern for her mother's well-being, rather than a desire to control her life. While the OP may have set boundaries that seem strict, these boundaries are rooted in a protective instinct, especially if she perceives that her mother may be in a harmful situation.

A new argument for the OP not being at fault is that expressing concern for a loved one's health and happiness is a valid and necessary action. The OP is trying to advocate for her mother's best interests, particularly if she believes the mother's partner could negatively impact her life. Instead of viewing the OP's actions as controlling, they can be seen as a necessary intervention to help her mother reflect on her choices. By initiating this conversation, the OP is fostering an opportunity for growth and awareness, which can ultimately lead to a healthier relationship dynamic.The original poster is at fault because, despite her good intentions, she is failing to respect her mother's autonomy and agency. By issuing ultimatums and trying to dictate her mother's relationships, the OP risks alienating her mother and creating a defensive atmosphere, which may lead to further estrangement rather than positive change. 

Additionally, the OP's approach may inadvertently reinforce the very behavior she seeks to modify. When a loved one feels controlled or judged, they are more likely to cling to the relationships deemed undesirable out of rebellion or a need for independence. A healthier approach would involve open communication and support, allowing the mother to feel empowered to make her own choices while still feeling cared for and understood. This would foster a stronger bond and create an environment where her mother feels safe to discuss her relationships without fear of judgment or rejection.

In response to the last YTA argument, it’s crucial to understand that the original poster’s actions are driven by genuine concern for her mother’s well-being. The OP is not at fault for wanting to protect her mother from potential harm, especially if she believes that her mother's relationship may be detrimental to her health or happiness.

A new argument for the OP not being at fault is that advocating for a loved one's well-being is a natural and necessary part of being in a caring relationship. The OP's intention to express her concerns about her mother's partner, especially if she perceives negative influences, reflects a proactive stance in safeguarding her mother’s emotional health. By voicing these concerns, the OP is opening the door to important conversations about relationships and well-being, which can ultimately lead to a more supportive relationship. This approach emphasizes the importance of having difficult discussions in the interest of a loved one’s health, rather than simply accepting situations that may be harmful.","{'score': 2, 'criteria': 'The response demonstrates minimal grounding as it presents opinions without citation of specific sources or clear referencing of factual knowledge.', 'supporting_evidence': ""The arguments presented focus on the original poster's intentions and interpretations of actions, stating they stem from concern but lack substantial grounding in factual evidence or specific examples related to the dynamics of the situation or potential impacts on relationships.""}","**YTA (You're the Asshole) Arguments:**
1. The original poster (OP) is imposing her own judgments and decisions on her mother, undermining her autonomy as an adult. This creates an adversarial dynamic that could damage their relationship.
2. The OP's approach of issuing ultimatums can make her mother feel cornered and judged, which may lead to defensiveness and withdrawal.
3. The insistence on dictating her mother's social interactions could backfire, prompting her mother to cling to undesirable relationships out of rebellion, ultimately undermining the OP's intentions.

**NTA (Not the Asshole) Arguments:**
1. The OP's actions are rooted in genuine concern for her mother's well-being rather than a desire to control her life. She aims to protect her mother from potential harm.
2. Setting boundaries is a crucial aspect of caring for loved ones, and the OP's intentions reflect a proactive stance in safeguarding her mother's emotional health.
3. By expressing her concerns, the OP encourages dialogue about relationships and promotes awareness, which can lead to a healthier dynamic.

**Conclusion:**
Both sides present compelling arguments. The YTA perspective highlights the importance of respecting autonomy and fostering open communication without ultimatums, which are crucial for maintaining a healthy relationship. In contrast, the NTA perspective emphasizes the role of a caring daughter in voicing concerns for her mother's well-being.

However, the YTA arguments address the potential negative consequences of the OP's behavior, suggesting that her approach could inadvertently harm the relationship she seeks to protect. The NTA arguments, while valid in their concern, do not sufficiently address the potential fallout of the OP's controlling behavior.

Ultimately, the emphasis on respecting autonomy and fostering genuine communication resonates more strongly, leading to the conclusion that the OP's approach is more problematic than protective.

1o8lauo,AITA if I drop off a note and baked goods to my neighbor who made me pick up somebody else’s dog poop?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o8lauo/aita_if_i_drop_off_a_note_and_baked_goods_to_my/,YTA,NTA,False,"My SO (M33) and I (F32) moved into a new area. I’m careful about my dog going potty on lawns, I ALWAYS pick it up and bring extra bags. Tonight on our walk, our dog went potty immediately. Picked it up and looped around back towards our house from the other direction. Close to home he sniffed another dogs poo and we kept going.   We’re at our door when I hear somebody running up behind startling us. A guy is coming at us with “Your dog pooped on my lawn and you need to pick it up”. I say calmly, “I know for a fact that didn’t happen, you’ve got the wrong dog”. He insists it JUST HAPPENED, he saw it, and has it on camera. I say, “Let’s see the footage because I’m POSITIVE”. My SO didn’t want it to escalate so he says, “Let’s go take a look”. Neighbor puts his hand on my SO’s back and pushes him towards his house. They are of similar cultural background so maybe ok but I didn't like it. I look down and see I have our bag in my hand and yell ahead to them. They didn’t hear me or my SO didn’t want me to get involved. I take a breath, drop off the dog, and head back. If by some miracle my dog had gone without me noticing I would apologize and pick it up.   Neighbor shows me over to where it is and points to the poo in question, I shine my light and I can’t help but literally start laughing out loud. Every oz of diplomacy failed at that moment. It was white, dry, hard as a rock, and TINY. Obviously been sitting there for a long time and where I saw my dog smelling it. I said incredulously, *“*That’s not my dog’s poop, can’t you see how hard it is? It’s old”. He answers, “I’m not here to argue with you-just pick it up.” Now, I’m pissed. I know my SO hates when I argue with people, but I have a strong respect complex. I look this man dead in the face as I scoop it up and say, “Funny how you don’t want to ‘argue’ but you want to make me pick up somebody else’s DOG SHIT. Where’s the camera footage? Would love to see it”. Then my SO hurries me away towards home.  He tells me we should be the bigger people and reminds me there’s so many bigger things in life. Says he also laughed, told him it was super old and also made it clear we didn’t do it. Told him “you must be having a hard time with this issue if you’re having to literally run after people. I’m sorry this happens to you so much”. SO doesn’t let things like that get to him and always feels bad for the out of line person. I often feel the need to correct them. In the grand scheme of things it’s just a piece of poo. But the principle is what gets me. Now here’s where I might be an ahole: I’m considering baking him treats and dropping them with a note like “I’m the bigger person we got off on the wrong foot but you’re still totally wrong and I’m not the one”. My SO thinks it isn’t necessary, and we should ignore him. I’m not trying to start anything bigger but I’m also not a doormat.

Bringing baked goods and a note as a passive-aggressive gesture is not only unnecessary but also undermines the potential for a positive neighborly relationship. Instead of fostering goodwill, this behavior perpetuates hostility and could lead to further misunderstandings in the future. Ignoring the situation, as suggested by their partner, would have been the more mature and constructive approach.

New argument for the OP not being at fault: The OP showed a willingness to communicate and resolve the issue directly by engaging with the neighbor about the noise complaint. This proactive approach demonstrates a commitment to maintaining a peaceful living environment, which is a responsible action that reflects maturity.

New argument for the OP being at fault: The OP's insistence on bringing baked goods and a note as a means of addressing the issue reflects an inability to take accountability for their role in the situation. Rather than acknowledging the neighbor's perspective and working toward a solution, the OP's actions come off as patronizing. This not only fails to address the root of the problem but also perpetuates a cycle of passive-aggressive behavior, which is detrimental to community harmony. The OP should have recognized that effective communication involves respect and empathy, rather than sarcasm and condescension.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that the original poster (OP) engaged in a light-hearted mockery of the neighbor, this approach can be seen as an attempt to introduce humor into an uncomfortable situation rather than escalate it.

1o8l7hm,AITA: I accidentally bad-mouthed one of the other clubs and the coach overheard me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o8l7hm/aita_i_accidentally_badmouthed_one_of_the_other/,YTA,YTA,True,"Context: I have been training waterpolo for about a year, and where i am there are 4 major clubs that do not represent the country. For the sake of privacy i will reference them as club 1,2,3 and 4 and they are not ranked based on skill or anything like that. Im not the best by any means, infact i think of myself as the worst one there, but i have experience playing for all of them other than club 1.  Now onto the story. So finnaly after one year of being the newest member of club 2, someone else decided to join. This got me excited, and after practice was over i went over to him and decided to be a good teammate and talk to him so he feels welcomed into the club. We met in the lobby after we got dressed from practice and talked a decent bit. I decided to tell him how i got my first golden medal. I told him that even though i play for club 2, on the yearly/grand tournament my coach decided to let the other teams borrow me for 2 reasons: i was the newest one there, being the least of value; and the other clubs where missing players. To be specific, team 3 which was a mixed club (men and women) was missing a goalkeeper, and also the rest of the club wasn't that sharp either as i was faster than all of them during warmups, and team 4 which litteraly had HALF of their players borrowed from either club 1 or 2. Due to these reasons i told him that here there are basically 2 good clubs, club 1 and 2, and that the others suck. (Now even though i barely played for my team, i still won gold because my team won gold, but i dont think this is relevant to the story)  Well as it turns out the coach for team 4 happened to be in the lobby, and when he heard what i said he got defensive and told us that thier club will be good, and that i was playing against thier underaged players.  I feel bad that he heard that, and of course no body wants to hear bas stuff about themselves or something they've poured time into and also because i played for them in the tournament, but i feel like what i said was only the truth as yes, they do suck in comparison to club 1 and 2, while also furhter proving my point as due to the fact that they needed to borrow players in the first olace meant they weren't good enough to compete in the first olace. Also i think that i said nothing wrong - only the trith that happens to be cold and harsh. It wasnt directed as an insult, but only the truth so the new teammate could get a better understanding of the competition.  So am i the asshole?",,"Yes, you are the asshole because your comments were disrespectful and dismissive of the hard work and dedication that players from club 3 and 4 put into their sport. Regardless of your intention to provide insight to a new teammate, belittling other clubs undermines the spirit of teamwork and sportsmanship. Your words can demoralize players who are striving to improve, and your lack of consideration for their feelings shows a lack of maturity. It's important to foster a supportive environment rather than perpetuate negativity about others.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s important to recognize that the original poster's intent was not to belittle or disrespect but to offer constructive feedback based on their own experiences. They may have been trying to motivate their teammate by discussing the differences in skill levels between clubs, which can be a common way to encourage improvement. The context of sports often includes discussions about competition levels to help team members understand where they stand and how they can grow.

Additionally, a new argument for the original poster not being at fault is that they were likely trying to prepare their teammate for the realities of competition. By discussing the differences in skill levels among clubs, the original poster may have been aiming to set realistic expectations and encourage their teammate to strive for excellence. This kind of honest dialogue is crucial in sports, as it helps players set goals and understand the journey ahead, rather than fostering a false sense of complacency.Refuting the last NTA argument, while the original poster may have intended to motivate their teammate, the approach taken was inconsiderate and damaging. It's one thing to provide constructive feedback, but outright comparing clubs in a demeaning way can come off as elitist or dismissive of others' efforts. Motivation can be achieved through encouragement and support rather than highlighting differences in skill levels in a negative light.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that they failed to consider the emotional impact of their words on their teammate. Instead of fostering a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, the original poster's comments could create feelings of inadequacy or discouragement. In a team environment, it’s crucial to uplift and support each other, especially when someone is new. By not being mindful of how their remarks could be perceived, the original poster contributed to a potentially toxic atmosphere rather than a nurturing one.

Refuting the last YTA argument, while it's valid to emphasize the importance of sportsmanship and camaraderie, it can also be argued that honest discussions about skill levels are a part of competitive sports. The original poster's comments may have been a way of preparing their teammate for the realities of the game, encouraging them to recognize the challenges ahead and to strive for improvement. The intent was likely not to belittle but to provide insight that could ultimately be beneficial.

A new argument for the author not being at fault is that they were sharing their own experiences to help their teammate navigate the competitive landscape. In sports, acknowledging the differences in skill levels among clubs can serve as a valuable learning opportunity. Instead of being seen as disrespectful, the original poster's comments could be interpreted as an attempt to mentor and guide a newcomer, ensuring they approach their training with the right mindset and understanding of what lies ahead. In this context, the original poster's role as a more experienced teammate can be seen as a positive contribution rather than a fault.Refuting the last NTA argument, while it’s true that discussing skill levels in sports can provide valuable context, the original poster's phrasing was dismissive and could easily be misconstrued as elitist. Their comments not only risked undermining the confidence of their new teammate but also belittled the efforts of players from clubs 3 and 4. Even if the intent was to prepare the teammate for competition, delivering the message in a more supportive manner would have been far more effective and respectful.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that they failed to recognize the importance of fostering an inclusive and encouraging environment within the team. By openly diminishing the capabilities of players from other clubs, the original poster not only alienated potential allies but also contributed to a culture of negativity. A teammate's success is often built on support from others, and by disregarding the accomplishments and dedication of players from different backgrounds, the original poster undermined the very essence of teamwork, which is to lift each other up rather than tear others down.

Refuting the last YTA argument, while the importance of sportsmanship and respect is undeniable, the original poster's intent was likely not to demean but to share their perspective in a competitive context. In sports, discussions about skill levels can serve as an important part of strategy and preparation. Rather than being dismissive, the original poster may have been trying to set realistic expectations and encourage their teammate to strive for improvement.

A new argument for the author not being at fault is that they were attempting to provide context and insight based on their own experiences to help their teammate navigate the competitive landscape. By highlighting the differences in skill levels, the original poster may have intended to motivate their teammate to work harder and understand the challenges ahead. This kind of honest dialogue can be crucial in sports, as it helps players recognize areas for growth and encourages a mindset focused on improvement, rather than fostering a false sense of security. Thus, the original poster's comments might be seen as a form of mentorship rather than a fault.Refuting the last NTA argument, while the original poster may have intended to provide helpful context, the manner in which they did so was disrespectful and dismissive of the hard work put in by players at other clubs. Intent does not negate the impact of their words; belittling others’ efforts can create a toxic environment that discourages teamwork and mutual respect. The poster could have chosen a more supportive way to communicate their thoughts without undermining others.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that they failed to consider the importance of promoting a positive team culture. By focusing on the perceived shortcomings of players from clubs 3 and 4, the original poster risked alienating their teammate and fostering an environment of negativity. In sports, it's critical to build each other up rather than create divisions based on skill levels. The original poster’s comments could have discouraged collaboration and camaraderie within the team, ultimately harming the overall team dynamic and morale. A supportive approach would have better served both the new teammate and the team as a whole.

Refuting the last YTA argument, while the emphasis on sportsmanship and respect is essential, the original poster's comments may have stemmed from a place of wanting to prepare their teammate for the realities of competition. Discussing skill levels is often part of fostering a competitive spirit, and the intent might have been to encourage the new teammate to rise to the challenge rather than to belittle others. The original poster's approach, albeit flawed, was likely aimed at motivating rather than demoralizing.

Intent does not excuse the impact of their words, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and demoralization among players from other clubs. Instead of fostering a spirit of healthy competition, the original poster's comments could create a negative atmosphere that undermines the very essence of teamwork.

A new argument for the author being at fault is that they demonstrated a lack of empathy and awareness of their teammate's feelings. In a team environment, especially with new players, it’s crucial to create a supportive atmosphere that encourages growth and confidence. By openly criticizing other clubs and implying that their teammate's abilities are inferior, the original poster not only failed to uplift their teammate but also risked alienating them. An effective teammate should strive to build others up rather than create divisions based on perceived skill levels, and in this instance, the original poster fell short of that responsibility.

Refuting the last YTA argument, while it’s true that the original poster's comments may have come off as dismissive, their intent was likely to provide context and prepare their teammate for the competitive nature of the sport. In competitive environments, discussing differences in skill levels can be a way to motivate individuals to improve and set realistic expectations. This approach, though potentially flawed in delivery, can foster a sense of awareness about the challenges ahead rather than merely discouraging.

1o8l5d7,AITA for not wanting to pay my opiate addict mom 400 dollars rent?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1o8l5d7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_my_opiate_addict_mom/,YTA,NTA,False,"I’m 20 years old and my mom has been an addict for as long as i can remember. When i turned 18 she lost 1000 dollars a month from her social security so it was a big change. I finally have a part time job and make about 400 dollars each check (give or take bcz i don’t have a set amount of hours.) My mom is demanding half of every check and i don’t want to give it to her as she is an opioid addict. And quite frankly has never been good with money. She already spends my 160 that i get on my food card every month by ordering name brand groceries and so much meat and fruit that goes to waste.   On top of that my friend who lives with us also pays her rent. My mom never asked for me to pay rent until 1. she got her other pain meds cut off and 2. when my friend moved in and started paying her rent.   My mom also went bankrupt for the second time a few months ago. She is already talking about getting a loan for a car while her license is also suspended. I don’t feel comfy paying a drug addict that i know very well half of my pay check.   I get that she is in pain and has back issues and surgeries coming up and  she really does want to get clean but im tired of seeing no progress and trusting her word. Not even two days latter my friend gave her 400 she was coming to me saying she had no money for cigs or umo fare.   She gets mad when i talk about moving and saying why would i want to pay rent somewhere else and it’s gonna be more. I know it will be more but giving the living situation i am in current, it’s not worth a dime.   On top of it all i found out that i am pregnant so i really can’t be living here and like this nor am i gonna be giving her money that i will need more than ever to someone who doesn’t know how to budget and is just gonna spend it on drugs. Every morning day and night i have to check on her making sure shes not folded like a lawn chair. I can’t take care of a kid and her.   Edit: In no way do I plan on staying here for very long especially if she doesn’t start taking big steps very soon. My bf really wants to be here for me and step up and get better job so we can get our own place. I am gonna ask my boss to move up to full time so I can better prepare for my next steps aswell. I know i am not responsible but I never needed to be before and I am gonna do everything I can to make this life worth living for me and my kid.   And tbh all i am seeing in the comments is stuff that i am fundamentally aware of, so it’s more so just solidifying stuff i already know and will need to do. So everyone telling me this is a bad situation and that i am irresponsible. I KNOW THAT, that is why things need to change and I want to change them FAST.   At this point it’s not even about the rent money or if i am the asshole. i just wanted to hear everything i already know so i don’t feel like im just abandoning her for no reason. It’s so unfair that i am the one that was left with this, so proud of my sibling for getting out but god this just sucks all around.   I’ll be sure to update yall when i make it out✌️",,"While it's understandable that the original poster feels overwhelmed by their circumstances, they are ultimately responsible for their own choices and financial independence. By refusing to contribute to their mother's rent, they are neglecting their obligation to support her, especially given that she is facing significant hardships. As a family member, it is important to show compassion and find a way to help, even if that means setting boundaries. Instead of completely withdrawing support, the poster could explore ways to assist their mother in managing her finances or seeking treatment, rather than abandoning her in a time of need.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's essential to recognize that the original poster's decision to not contribute to their mother's rent stems from a desire to prioritize their own mental health and financial stability. The assertion that they have an obligation to support their mother overlooks the complexities of their relationship and the potential negative impact of enabling unhealthy patterns, such as financial dependency or neglecting personal well-being. 

Additionally, a new argument for the author not being at fault is that setting boundaries is a crucial aspect of maintaining a healthy relationship. By refusing to contribute to their mother's rent, the original poster is not abandoning her but rather taking a necessary step to ensure they do not compromise their own stability. This decision can ultimately encourage their mother to seek alternative solutions and take responsibility for her own financial situation, which can lead to healthier dynamics in the long run.While it's understandable to empathize with the original poster's circumstances, they are ultimately at fault for their lack of support towards their mother. The argument that they are prioritizing their own mental health and financial stability overlooks the fact that families often have a responsibility to help each other, especially in times of need. By refusing to contribute to their mother's rent, the poster is essentially abandoning her during a difficult period, which can exacerbate her struggles and lead to further emotional distress for both parties.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that setting boundaries does not mean entirely withdrawing support. The poster could have approached the situation differently by offering assistance in a way that aligns with their own limits, such as helping their mother find resources or discussing budget management. Instead, they chose to disengage completely, which lacks compassion and fails to foster a sense of familial responsibility. Ultimately, the poster's decision to not provide any form of support highlights a lack of accountability and care for their mother's well-being, making them at fault in this situation.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to emphasize that the original poster's choice to prioritize their own mental health and financial stability is not indicative of abandonment, but rather a necessary measure to protect themselves from potential emotional and financial strain. The assertion that they have a familial obligation to support their mother fails to consider the complexities of their relationship and the potential harm that enabling unhealthy behaviors can cause.

Moreover, a new argument for the author not being at fault is that they are taking a proactive step towards encouraging their mother to seek independence and responsibility. By not contributing to her rent, the original poster is signaling that their mother's situation requires her own active engagement and problem-solving. This boundary can ultimately empower their mother to address her financial issues more seriously rather than relying on the poster as a safety net, leading to a healthier dynamic in the long run.While it's understandable to empathize with the circumstances, the original poster is ultimately at fault for their lack of support towards their mother. The argument that they are prioritizing their own mental health and financial stability overlooks the responsibilities that come with family relationships. By refusing to contribute to their mother's rent, the poster is not just setting a boundary; they are abandoning her during a challenging time, which can exacerbate her struggles and lead to further emotional distress for both parties.

Additionally, a new argument for the author being at fault is that their decision to completely disengage can reinforce feelings of isolation and despair in their mother. Rather than helping her find solutions or encouraging her to seek help, the poster's choice to withdraw support may push her further into a negative mindset. Instead, they could have offered assistance in a way that respects their boundaries while still demonstrating care, such as helping her explore financial resources or encouraging her to seek professional help. This lack of engagement not only reflects a failure to support a family member in need but also indicates a missed opportunity to foster positive change in their mother's life.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s important to highlight that the original poster's decision to prioritize their mental health and financial stability does not equate to abandonment. The complexity of familial relationships often requires setting boundaries to protect one's well-being, especially when past experiences may have involved enabling unhealthy behaviors. The assertion that they are at fault for not supporting their mother overlooks the potential harm of continuing to provide financial assistance without addressing the underlying issues.

Additionally, a new argument for the author not being at fault is that refusing to contribute to their mother’s rent can serve as a catalyst for positive change. By not providing financial support, the original poster is encouraging their mother to take responsibility for her own situation, which may ultimately lead her to seek the help she needs. This decision fosters a healthier dynamic that can empower their mother to find solutions rather than relying on her child for support, ultimately benefiting both parties in the long run.While it's understandable to empathize with the circumstances, the original poster is ultimately at fault for their lack of support towards their mother.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's essential to recognize that the original poster's decision to prioritize their mental health and financial stability is a valid choice, particularly when considering the potential negative impact of enabling unhealthy behaviors in their mother. The assertion that they should unconditionally support their mother overlooks the importance of self-preservation and the need for boundaries in family relationships.

Additionally, a new argument for the author not being at fault is that by refusing to contribute to their mother’s rent, they are taking a necessary step to encourage their mother to seek greater independence and responsibility. This decision may prompt their mother to explore alternative solutions, such as financial assistance programs or therapy, which could ultimately lead to a more sustainable improvement in her situation. In this way, the original poster is not abandoning their mother but rather fostering an opportunity for growth and self-sufficiency, which benefits both parties in the long run.While it may seem that the original poster is justified in prioritizing their own mental health and financial stability, they are ultimately at fault for their lack of support for their mother. The argument that they are setting healthy boundaries overlooks the emotional weight of familial responsibility. By completely withdrawing financial support, the poster risks exacerbating their mother's already difficult situation, potentially leading to further distress and isolation.

Additionally, a new argument for the author being at fault is that their refusal to contribute can undermine their mother's ability to seek help or make necessary changes. Instead of providing a lifeline that could assist her in finding resources or support, the poster's decision may reinforce a cycle of dependency or despair. They could have approached the situation differently by offering support in a way that respects their boundaries while still encouraging their mother to take steps toward independence. Choosing to disengage entirely reflects a lack of compassion and responsibility that ultimately harms their mother and the family dynamic.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster's decision to prioritize their own mental health and financial stability is both valid and necessary. The assertion that they are at fault for not supporting their mother fails to consider the potential emotional and financial toll that enabling unhealthy behaviors can have on the poster. They are not abandoning their mother but rather making a choice to protect their own well-being, which is essential in maintaining a healthy family dynamic.

Furthermore, a new argument for the author not being at fault is that their refusal to contribute to their mother’s rent can serve as a pivotal moment for growth. By not providing financial support, the original poster is encouraging their mother to seek alternative solutions, such as financial assistance programs or therapy, which may ultimately help her become more self-sufficient. This decision can foster a sense of accountability in the mother, prompting her to take charge of her situation rather than relying on her child. In this way, the original poster is not only looking out for their own best interests but also potentially guiding their mother toward a path of greater independence and responsibility.","{'score': 2, 'criteria': 'The response contains minimal grounding, primarily relying on general claims about familial responsibility with limited factual support.', 'supporting_evidence': 'The response lacks specific citations or factual references to support claims about family obligations, setting boundaries, or the impact of addiction, leading to minimal grounding.'}","### Summary of Arguments

**YTA (You're The Asshole) Arguments:**
1. The original poster (OP) is neglecting their familial responsibility by refusing to support their mother during a difficult time, which could exacerbate her struggles.
2. While setting boundaries is important, disengaging completely lacks compassion and does not foster a sense of accountability or support for their mother.
3. The decision to not contribute can isolate the mother further and prevent her from seeking help or finding solutions, reflecting a failure to support a family member in need.

**NTA (Not The Asshole) Arguments:**
1. The OP's choice to prioritize their own mental health and financial stability is valid and necessary, particularly to avoid enabling unhealthy behaviors in their mother.
2. Setting boundaries can be crucial for maintaining healthy family dynamics, and the OP's refusal to contribute is not abandonment but a protective measure.
3. By not providing financial support, the OP may encourage their mother to seek independence and responsibility, prompting her to explore alternative solutions that would ultimately lead to positive change.

### Determination of Winner

Upon evaluating the arguments, the NTA side presents a compelling case for the necessity of self-care and boundary-setting in the context of familial relationships. It highlights the potential harm that enabling behaviors can cause and argues that the OP's decision can foster growth and independence for the mother. While the YTA arguments focus on familial obligations and emotional support, they do not adequately address the complexities of the situation or the potential for negative outcomes resulting from enabling.

Given the strength of the reasoning in the NTA arguments, particularly concerning self-preservation and the potential for positive transformation in the mother’s life, the conclusion favors the NTA perspective.

1oacydb,AITA for not spending time with my mum?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oacydb/aita_for_not_spending_time_with_my_mum/,NTA,NTA,True,"I F21 still live at home with both of my parents and my adult brother. A reoccurring argument my mother and I have is that I don’t “hang out” with her as much as she’d like. Saying this, when we are both at home we don’t have issue being in one another’s space, walking our dogs together, cooking together or doing activities together (jigsaw puzzles, art etc) Today she asked me to join her and watch a local boat race and I declined. She then didn’t go because she didn’t want to go alone, and expressed frustration and an annoyance over my constant reluctance to hang out with her and now there is obvious tension between use. She makes me feel like I owe her more of my time. I’d understand if I lived out of home and we didn’t see each other every day, but I don’t believe I deserve to be guilt tripped into spending time with my mother, am I the asshole?",,"While it's important to maintain personal autonomy, the OP is failing to recognize the emotional needs of her mother. Relationships require effort from both sides, and spending quality time together can strengthen their bond. By consistently declining invitations, the OP is inadvertently dismissing her mother's feelings and desires for connection, which could lead to feelings of isolation. A little compromise and willingness to engage in shared activities could go a long way in fostering a healthier relationship. Therefore, the OP is at fault for not valuing this aspect of their relationship.

Refuting the previous YTA argument, it's essential to recognize that the original poster (OP) is not at fault for prioritizing her own wellbeing and boundaries. While maintaining relationships is important, it should not come at the cost of one's mental health or personal comfort. The OP has the right to choose how she spends her time, and if she finds the interactions with her mother to be draining or detrimental to her wellbeing, she is justified in setting those boundaries.

A new concise argument in support of the OP is that everyone has different social needs and comfort levels. Just because the mother desires more frequent contact does not obligate the OP to comply if it negatively impacts her. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect for each other's boundaries, and the OP is merely asserting her right to manage her own social interactions in a way that works for her. Thus, she should not be faulted for prioritizing her own needs.Refuting the previous NTA argument, it's crucial to consider that while the OP's wellbeing is important, completely shutting down opportunities for connection can have negative consequences on familial relationships. The mother may feel rejected and unloved, which could lead to long-term estrangement. Healthy relationships require compromise and effort, and by consistently declining invitations, the OP risks alienating her mother further, which is detrimental for both parties.

A new concise argument for the OP being at fault is that she is missing the opportunity to foster a meaningful connection with her mother. Even if the interactions are not always enjoyable, participating occasionally in shared activities can create moments of understanding and bonding. By dismissing these chances outright, the OP is not only denying her mother the chance to express love and connection but also potentially hindering her own emotional growth and the overall family dynamic. Thus, the OP should be open to finding a balance that respects both her needs and her mother’s desire for connection.

Refuting the previous YTA argument, it's crucial to understand that while maintaining personal boundaries is important, completely shutting down opportunities for connection can have negative repercussions on familial relationships. The mother's feelings of rejection and loneliness could exacerbate the situation, leading to long-term estrangement. Healthy relationships require some level of compromise and effort; by consistently declining invitations, the OP risks alienating her mother further, which is detrimental to both parties.

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault is that she has every right to prioritize her mental health and personal comfort. Everyone has different social needs and comfort levels, and just because the mother desires more frequent contact does not obligate the OP to comply if it negatively impacts her. By asserting her boundaries, the OP is taking care of herself, which is essential in maintaining any healthy relationship. In this light, she should not be faulted for prioritizing her own needs while navigating a complex family dynamic.Refuting the previous NTA argument, it's important to recognize that while the original poster (OP) is prioritizing her mental health, completely shutting down opportunities for connection can have damaging effects on familial relationships.

By dismissing these chances outright, the OP not only denies her mother the chance to express love and connection but also potentially hinders her own emotional growth. Therefore, the OP should be open to finding a balance that respects both her needs and her mother’s desire for connection, as this can foster a healthier family dynamic.

Refuting the previous YTA argument, it's essential to consider that while the original poster (OP) is prioritizing her mental health, completely shutting down opportunities for connection can have damaging effects on familial relationships. The mother may feel rejected and unloved, leading to potential long-term estrangement. Healthy relationships require some level of compromise and effort; by consistently declining invitations, the OP risks alienating her mother further, which ultimately harms both parties.

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault is that she is entitled to prioritize her mental health and personal comfort. Everyone has different social needs and comfort levels; just because the mother desires more frequent contact does not obligate the OP to comply if those interactions negatively impact her. By setting boundaries, the OP is taking necessary steps to protect her wellbeing, which is essential for maintaining any healthy relationship. In this light, she should not be blamed for prioritizing her own needs while navigating a complex family dynamic.Refuting the previous NTA argument, it's important to recognize that while the original poster (OP) is prioritizing her mental health, completely shutting down opportunities for connection with her mother can lead to negative consequences. The mother's feelings of rejection and loneliness can exacerbate the situation, potentially resulting in long-term estrangement. Healthy relationships require some level of compromise and engagement; by consistently declining invitations, the OP risks creating a deeper rift, which is detrimental to both parties.

A new concise argument for the OP being at fault is that she is missing valuable opportunities for connection and understanding with her mother. Even if the interactions can be challenging, participating occasionally in shared activities could foster moments of bonding and emotional growth. By dismissing these chances outright, the OP not only denies her mother the ability to express love and connection but also potentially limits her own emotional development. Thus, the OP should be open to finding a balance that respects both her needs and her mother’s desire for connection, as this can enhance their overall family dynamic.

The mother's feelings of rejection and loneliness may deepen over time, potentially resulting in estrangement or resentment. Healthy relationships require some effort and compromise; by continually declining invitations, the OP risks alienating her mother further, which can damage their bond in the long run.

A new concise argument for the OP being at fault is that she is overlooking the importance of nurturing familial relationships. Even if the interactions are uncomfortable or challenging, engaging with her mother occasionally can provide opportunities for growth and understanding. By dismissing these chances outright, the OP not only denies her mother the chance to feel loved and connected but also deprives herself of the potential benefits of that relationship. Therefore, the OP should consider finding a middle ground, where she can set boundaries while still making an effort to engage with her mother, fostering a healthier family dynamic overall.

Refuting the previous NTA argument, it's important to recognize that while the OP is prioritizing her mental health, consistently rejecting her mother's invitations can lead to significant emotional strain for both parties. The mother may feel increasingly rejected and isolated, which could deepen their relationship issues and create long-term resentment. Healthy relationships require some level of compromise and connection; by continually declining invitations, the OP risks driving a wedge between them, which can be detrimental to their bond.

A new concise argument for the OP being at fault is that she may be missing valuable opportunities to strengthen her relationship with her mother. Even if the interactions are uncomfortable or challenging, engaging with her mother occasionally can foster understanding and connection. By dismissing these opportunities outright, the OP not only denies her mother the chance to express love and care but also limits her own potential for personal growth and emotional resilience.

**YTA Arguments:**
1. The OP is failing to recognize her mother's emotional needs and desires for connection, which could lead to feelings of isolation.
2. Relationships require effort from both sides, and a little compromise from the OP could strengthen their bond.
3. By consistently declining invitations, the OP risks alienating her mother and potentially causing long-term estrangement.
4. The OP misses opportunities for meaningful connection and emotional growth by avoiding interactions.

**NTA Arguments:**
1. The OP has the right to prioritize her mental health and personal comfort, and her boundaries should be respected.
2. Everyone has different social needs, and the mother's desire for more contact does not obligate the OP to engage if it negatively impacts her.
3. Setting boundaries is essential for maintaining any healthy relationship; prioritizing well-being should not be seen as a fault.
4. The OP is justified in managing her social interactions in a way that works for her, and should not be blamed for asserting her needs.

**Conclusion:**
While both sides present valid points, the NTA perspective holds stronger weight. The OP’s priority of mental health and personal boundaries is essential in any relationship. While engagement with her mother is important, her right to set boundaries for her wellbeing cannot be overlooked. Thus, the argument that respects the OP's needs and acknowledges individual comfort levels is more compelling.

This is to avoid the hassle of putting them out in the morning or risk missing them being collected in case the binmen come early.   We forgot to put the bin out until I remembered at about 11pm. I brought our bin out and went back in. Bin got collected. Happy days.  My neighbour came up to me and got angry at me because I brought the bin out too late and that it was too noisy when they were trying to sleep. I apologised several times for this and told them that it won't happen again, but they just kept giving out about it and then walked back into their house without accepting it or even acknowledging it.  I went back inside, explained what happened to my fiancee. They think that:  1. They are being unreasonable telling us when we can and can't take our bin out. 2. That they were rude to walk away from me without acknowledging my apology. 3. That if they didn't want to hear outside noises that they shouldn't keep their bedroom windows open (they keep their bedroom window open every night)  I'll be more considerate about this going forward, either making sure to bring the bin out earlier or carrying the bin to the collection point so as to avoid the wheels making any noise, but them getting angry about it to me has taken me back a bit, and I feel like she doesn't like us anymore.  Just wondering what you guys think?",,"YTA because you should be considerate of your neighbors' peace, especially late at night. While it may seem like a minor inconvenience to you, the noise from wheeling out a bin can disrupt their sleep. It's important to be mindful of shared living spaces and the impact your actions have on others, particularly during late hours. Apologizing is a good start, but being proactive about minimizing noise in the future is essential for maintaining a respectful neighborhood relationship.

In response to the YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster (OP) is not at fault for simply taking out the trash, as this is a necessary household chore that everyone must perform. The act of wheeling out a bin, even late at night, is a normal part of life and should not be viewed as a significant disturbance. 

Additionally, the OP may have been unaware of the noise level at that hour. Many people have different thresholds for what constitutes ""disruption,"" and it is unreasonable to expect someone to alter their routine without prior knowledge of the potential impact on others. 

**New Argument:** The OP's actions were reasonable and within the bounds of normal behavior. Taking out the trash is a routine task that is essential for maintaining a clean living environment. If the neighbors are particularly sensitive to noise, they should communicate their concerns directly rather than expecting others to guess what might disturb them. Open communication is key in a community, and the OP should not be held responsible for the neighbors' inability to express their needs.In response to the YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster (OP) is not at fault for simply taking out the trash, as this is a necessary household chore that everyone must perform.

His ex roommate has been dating this girl on&amp;off the past year or so. Ive had minimal interactions w her but everytime ive seen her in person she says nothing to me unless I say hi first then shell say hi. Shes told my bfs roommate from the get go that shes worried he wants to date me&amp;that im flirting w him. Both my bf&amp; his room mate know this isnt true. My bf and I have a really good relationship&amp; theres never been attraction or flirtation between me&amp;his room mate or any1 else for that matter  Room mates gf has messaged me several times on fb telling me she knows im attracted to her bf &amp; that I exclude her by not saying hi when I see her(shes referencing a time when she didnt hear me say hi&amp; found it rude). She doesnt believe me or my bf when we tell her im not attracted to her bf. She also asked me to stop talking to her bf &amp; i told her im not going to ignore him when im at my bfs house &amp; his rm-mate starts talking to both of us.   She even snooped so far back on my fb &amp; found a post I shared 10 or so years ago &amp; sent it to her bf w no context, asking him if he liked it&amp;when he said yeah she told him i had posted it(It wasnt even my original post, i just shared smthing). Her mssges&amp;stalking my fb were so anxiety inducing at one point I blocked her. She then found me on insta&amp;sent me a message telling me i was petty for blocking her,which I didnt even notice until she screen shot it, sent it to my bf&amp;then blocked him I unblocked her cause I felt bad and to explain why id blocked her in the first place Also she wont say a single thing to me in person &amp;ive invited her to hang w us several times but she never comes  Recently she &amp;her bf broke up. Its happened a couple times &amp; im not super close w my bfs rm-mate so I didnt think much of it until she sent me a message on fb telling me they broke up&amp; asking me if I could find him someone else to date. This is like within a week of them breaking up. I found this really weird and it made me even more anxious. I responded by telling her my bf, who was still living w him, could check on him&amp; left it at that  That brings us to the present. my bf moved in last week &amp; we invited his ex room mate over for this bon fire. I didnt think the gf would be a problem bc they arent 2gether but today he asked if she could come with. my bf &amp; I both said no.

Shes made me so anxious &amp; it honestly makes me feel crazy that she even asked to come w after everything My bf is more chill abt her coming over but hes also supportive of me not wanting to see her  AITA? Should I let her come over? I feel bad that my bfs friend isnt gonna come now &amp; im worried shes gonna isolate him from his friends esp if hes living alone now",,"The original poster is in the wrong because they are allowing their personal discomfort and anxiety about the girlfriend to dictate who can attend a social gathering at their home, which is unfair to both their boyfriend's friend and the girlfriend herself. Instead of fostering an inclusive environment, they are creating division and potentially jeopardizing their boyfriend's friendships. By refusing to allow her to come simply because of past interactions, they are being controlling and not making an effort to resolve the situation in a mature manner. It's important to prioritize open communication and inclusivity, especially when it comes to social gatherings that involve mutual friends.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the previous argument suggests that the original poster (OP) is being controlling by not wanting the girlfriend at their home, it's essential to recognize that the OP is prioritizing their own mental health and comfort. Hosting a gathering should not come at the expense of the host's well-being. If the OP feels anxious or uncomfortable around the girlfriend due to past experiences, it is entirely reasonable for them to set boundaries to protect their own emotional state.

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault: The OP is not at fault because they are exercising their right to create a safe and comfortable environment in their own home. Everyone has the right to determine who they feel comfortable hosting, especially when past interactions have led to anxiety. Setting boundaries is a healthy way to manage personal relationships, and the OP is simply asserting their needs in a situation that could otherwise lead to distress.Refuting the last NTA argument: While the argument emphasizes the OP's right to create a comfortable environment in their home, it overlooks the importance of fostering healthy relationships and communication. By refusing to invite the girlfriend, the OP is not only risking their boyfriend's friendships but also missing an opportunity to address any issues directly. Instead of setting a boundary, the OP is creating unnecessary division and conflict in their social circle, which can ultimately lead to resentment and isolation.

A new concise argument for the author being at fault: The OP is at fault because they are prioritizing their discomfort over the well-being of their boyfriend and his friends. By excluding the girlfriend from social events without attempting to resolve past issues, the OP is not only being unfair to her but also undermining their relationship with their boyfriend. Healthy relationships require compromise and understanding, and the OP's unwillingness to engage with the girlfriend reflects a lack of maturity and empathy.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the previous argument suggests that the original poster (OP) is risking their boyfriend's friendships by not inviting the girlfriend, it fails to consider that the OP's discomfort stems from genuine past issues that have affected their mental health. By setting a boundary regarding who can attend their home, the OP is prioritizing their emotional well-being, which is essential in maintaining healthy relationships. It’s not about excluding the girlfriend for no reason; it’s about protecting oneself from a situation that has previously caused distress.

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault: The OP is not at fault because they are taking a necessary step to protect their mental health in a situation that has historically caused them anxiety. It is their right to create a safe space in their own home, especially when past experiences have led them to feel uncomfortable. The OP's decision to exclude the girlfriend is a valid expression of their needs and boundaries, which is crucial for maintaining their emotional well-being.Refuting the last NTA argument: While the last argument emphasizes the OP's right to protect their emotional well-being, it overlooks the importance of fostering healthy relationships and communication. By excluding the girlfriend without attempting to resolve any issues directly, the OP is not only risking their boyfriend's friendships but also creating unnecessary drama. Healthy relationships thrive on open dialogue and compromise, and the OP's refusal to include the girlfriend may reflect a lack of willingness to engage in constructive communication.

A new concise argument for the author being at fault: The OP is at fault because they are allowing their personal discomfort to dictate the dynamics of their social circle, which can harm both their boyfriend and the girlfriend. Instead of seeking to address past issues collaboratively or allowing for the possibility of change, the OP is choosing to isolate the girlfriend, which can lead to resentment and further complications in their relationships. It's essential to prioritize not only personal comfort but also the health of the broader social environment.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the last argument highlights the importance of fostering healthy relationships and communication, it fails to recognize that the OP’s discomfort is a valid concern rooted in past experiences. The OP is not simply excluding the girlfriend out of spite; they are protecting their mental health by establishing boundaries that reflect their emotional needs. Ignoring personal boundaries can lead to greater conflict and distress, making it crucial for the OP to prioritize their well-being.

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault: The OP is not at fault because they are exercising their right to set boundaries in their own home based on past negative experiences. Mental health is paramount, and the OP's decision to exclude the girlfriend from social gatherings is a proactive measure to ensure their comfort and safety. It is entirely reasonable for individuals to create a space that aligns with their emotional needs, especially when previous interactions have caused anxiety.Refuting the last NTA argument: While the previous argument emphasizes the importance of setting boundaries for mental health, it neglects to consider the broader implications of the OP's actions on their relationships. By excluding the girlfriend from social gatherings without seeking resolution, the OP is not only risking their boyfriend's friendships but also perpetuating a cycle of negativity and division. Healthy relationships require proactive communication and a willingness to engage with others, rather than isolating oneself from potential conflicts.

A new concise argument for the author being at fault: The OP is at fault because they are prioritizing their discomfort over the opportunity for growth and reconciliation within their social circle. By refusing to invite the girlfriend, the OP is not only alienating her but also undermining their boyfriend's relationships. Rather than addressing their feelings directly and fostering a more inclusive environment, the OP is choosing to create unnecessary barriers that could lead to resentment and conflict in the future. This behavior reflects a lack of maturity and an unwillingness to engage with the complexities of interpersonal relationships.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the previous response highlights the importance of growth and reconciliation in relationships, it fails to acknowledge that the OP's discomfort is a legitimate concern based on past interactions that have caused them distress. The OP is not simply avoiding conflict; they are taking necessary steps to protect their mental health in a situation that has previously impacted them negatively. This boundary-setting is an important part of self-care and emotional well-being.

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault: The OP is not at fault because they are prioritizing their emotional safety in a potentially uncomfortable situation. It is entirely reasonable for someone to choose not to invite individuals into their home who have previously caused them distress. By establishing this boundary, the OP is ensuring they can maintain their peace of mind, which is crucial for a healthy host-guest dynamic. Ultimately, everyone has the right to create a safe environment for themselves, especially in their own space.Refuting the last NTA argument: While the emphasis on prioritizing emotional safety is valid, it overlooks the responsibility that comes with relationships. The OP’s choice to exclude the girlfriend without seeking any resolution or dialogue demonstrates a lack of willingness to engage constructively. Instead of addressing their discomfort through communication, the OP is creating an exclusionary environment that could harm both their relationship with their boyfriend and their broader social dynamic.

A new concise argument for the author being at fault: The OP is at fault because they are failing to demonstrate maturity and empathy by not allowing the opportunity for reconciliation. By excluding the girlfriend from gatherings, the OP is not only dismissing their boyfriend’s friendships but also missing a chance to foster understanding and potentially improve their own feelings about her. Navigating interpersonal relationships requires effort and the willingness to face discomfort, and the OP’s avoidance is detrimental to the growth of both their relationship and their social circle.

Refuting the last NTA argument: While the previous argument emphasizes the importance of emotional safety, it overlooks the potential for personal growth through confronting uncomfortable situations. The OP’s choice to exclude the girlfriend shows a reluctance to engage in meaningful dialogue that could help resolve past issues. Instead of fostering understanding and reconciliation, the OP is choosing to isolate themselves and their boyfriend from potential positive interactions, which can ultimately harm their relationship and social dynamics.

A new concise argument for the author being at fault: The OP is at fault because they are prioritizing their discomfort over the opportunity to build relationships and foster inclusivity. By excluding the girlfriend from social events, the OP is not only alienating her but also disregarding their boyfriend’s feelings and friendships. This refusal to engage with the girlfriend can breed resentment and misunderstandings, ultimately undermining the potential for a more harmonious social environment.

**YTA (You're the Asshole):**
- The OP is being unfair by prioritizing their discomfort over inclusivity and their boyfriend's friendships, risking division in their social circle.
- They are creating unnecessary drama and conflict by refusing to invite the girlfriend without attempting to resolve any past issues directly.
- This behavior reflects a lack of maturity and empathy, as they are missing an opportunity for growth and reconciliation within their relationships.
- Healthy relationships thrive on communication and compromise, and the OP's exclusion of the girlfriend undermines this principle.

**NTA (Not the Asshole):**
- The OP is protecting their mental health and emotional well-being by setting boundaries based on past negative experiences.
- They have the right to create a safe environment in their own home, especially when previous interactions with the girlfriend have caused distress.
- The OP's decision to exclude the girlfriend is a necessary measure to ensure their comfort and safety, which is important for healthy dynamics in their home.
- Setting boundaries is a valid expression of their needs, and ignoring these needs could lead to greater conflict and distress.

### Conclusion
Both sides present valid points, but the arguments for YTA emphasize the importance of communication and inclusivity in relationships, suggesting that the OP's avoidance could lead to long-term issues. In contrast, the NTA arguments focus on the OP's right to protect their mental health, which is also important. However, the repeated emphasis on the need for growth, understanding, and the potential negative impact on relationships ultimately tips the balance.

I hate cooking, but my mom seems to think I need to help her cook.  Some details that matter: 1) the kitchen is tiny, and there are 4 people in there now 2) my step dad micro manages everything that happens in the kitchen 3) I was invited to eat dinner, not cook it 4) even though my mom is sick and says she cant stand for very long, she is one of the 4 people in the kitchen 5) I dont enjoy cooking  So AITA for making my sick mom cook?  Obviously I forgot some info, only 3 of the 4 are cooking, my step dad is micro managing, my mom is not contagious, she is just having some womanly issues that are causing cramping. My mom will not sit down, she has to be forced down, and there is only room in the kitchen for 2 people to cook comfortably. And I was holding the baby  I find myself commenting this a lot, so im going to put it up here... I would NEVER invite someone over for dinner and expect them to cook it. That is ridiculous. There is a difference between offering to help and being told to help. Also if my mom knew she was going to tell me to help, she should have said that when she invited me. I would have gladly helped if she had said ""the plan is to go pick up dinner stuff, make it together and then eat"" but when she made the plans she said ""we will go get dinner and spend some time together""",,"The original poster is at fault for not recognizing the responsibility and support expected in a family setting, especially when their mother, despite her illness, is still attempting to contribute to the meal. While it's understandable that they dislike cooking, the situation calls for compassion and teamwork, particularly when their mother is struggling. Instead of refusing to help, the OP could have offered to assist in a way that accommodated her mother's condition, demonstrating care and solidarity rather than a self-centered approach.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s important to recognize that the OP's refusal to cook does not inherently indicate a lack of care or support for their mother. The OP may have valid reasons for their decision, such as personal boundaries, past experiences, or the need to prioritize their own mental health. It’s crucial to consider that the OP's choice to not cook does not equate to a lack of love or respect for their mother; rather, it reflects their own limits and understanding of their role in the family dynamic.

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault is that the OP has the right to set boundaries regarding their responsibilities, especially if cooking is a source of stress or discomfort for them. It’s essential for family members to respect each other’s limits, and by not cooking, the OP may be protecting their own well-being, which ultimately allows them to be more present and supportive in other ways.The original poster is at fault for failing to recognize that family dynamics often require compromise and support, especially during challenging times. While they may have reasons for not wanting to cook, their refusal to help when their mother is struggling demonstrates a lack of empathy. The OP should have considered that family members often need to step up for one another, particularly when someone is unwell. Instead of prioritizing their discomfort or dislike for cooking, the OP could have found a way to assist or compromise, thereby fostering a more supportive family environment.

Additionally, a key argument for the OP being at fault is that they missed an opportunity to strengthen familial bonds during a difficult period. By choosing not to engage in an essential family activity like cooking together, the OP not only let their mother down but also missed a chance to create shared experiences and memories that could benefit both their relationship and their mother's emotional well-being. A family is built on mutual support, and the OP's unwillingness to contribute undermines that foundation.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s important to note that the OP's decision not to cook does not reflect a lack of care for their mother. Instead, it may be a manifestation of personal boundaries or a desire to maintain their own mental well-being. This choice can be seen as a form of self-preservation, allowing the OP to engage with their family in other meaningful ways rather than forcing themselves into a role that causes them distress.

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault is that the OP has the right to prioritize their own mental health and well-being, especially in a challenging family situation. Cooking can be a significant emotional burden for some individuals, and by choosing not to cook, the OP is recognizing their limits. This self-awareness can lead to healthier interactions and support within the family, as the OP can focus on contributing in ways that align with their strengths and comfort levels.The original poster is at fault for their lack of willingness to support their mother during a difficult time. While they may have personal reasons for not wanting to cook, their refusal shows a lack of empathy and understanding of family dynamics. In moments of hardship, family members often need to come together, and the OP's unwillingness to contribute undermines the support system that is crucial for their mother’s well-being.

To further argue that the OP is at fault, it is important to highlight that they missed an opportunity to engage in a shared experience that can foster closeness and connection. Cooking together could have served as a bonding activity, providing emotional support to their mother while also allowing the OP to express care in a tangible way. By opting out, the OP not only let their mother down but also isolated themselves from an important familial interaction that could strengthen their relationship during a vulnerable time.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s crucial to recognize that the OP's refusal to cook does not equate to a lack of love or support for their mother. The OP may have legitimate personal reasons for their decision, such as mental health concerns or past negative experiences with cooking. Family dynamics are complex, and it's essential to understand that setting boundaries can sometimes be necessary for maintaining one's own well-being. The OP’s choice to not cook could stem from a desire to avoid additional stress, allowing them to be present in other ways that might be more supportive.

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault is that they are entitled to prioritize their own mental health and comfort. Cooking can be a significant emotional burden for some individuals, and the OP's decision to step back from that responsibility can actually preserve their capacity to support their mother in other meaningful ways. By recognizing their own limits, the OP is positioning themselves to engage with their family more healthily and sustainably, allowing for a more balanced family dynamic in the long run.The original poster is at fault for their unwillingness to help their mother during a difficult time, as this reflects a lack of empathy and support that is crucial in family relationships. While the OP may have their own reasons for not wanting to cook, their refusal to participate in a shared family responsibility, especially when their mother is unwell, demonstrates a disregard for the emotional needs of their family.

A new concise argument for the OP being at fault is that they failed to communicate effectively with their mother about their discomfort with cooking. Instead of simply refusing, the OP could have initiated a conversation to explore alternatives, such as cooking together or finding a compromise that would allow them to contribute without feeling overwhelmed. This lack of communication not only limited their opportunity to support their mother but also created an emotional distance that could have been avoided with a more collaborative approach. By not engaging in this dialogue, the OP missed a chance to strengthen their relationship and demonstrate solidarity during a challenging time.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to emphasize that the OP’s refusal to cook does not stem from a lack of care for their mother but rather from personal boundaries. Everyone has different capacities for handling stress and emotional burdens, and the OP may be prioritizing their mental health to ensure they can engage with their family in ways that are supportive and manageable for them. It's not uncommon for individuals to have varying comfort levels with family responsibilities, and asserting those boundaries can be a necessary part of maintaining healthy relationships.

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault is that they have the right to prioritize their own well-being, especially in a family context where stress and illness are present. By choosing not to cook, the OP is acknowledging their limits, which allows them to engage in other forms of support that may be more aligned with their strengths. This self-awareness can foster a healthier family dynamic, as it encourages open communication about needs and boundaries rather than forcing someone into a role that may lead to resentment or burnout. In this way, the OP’s decision may ultimately contribute to a more sustainable and supportive family environment.The original poster is at fault for their lack of willingness to help their mother during a challenging time. While it’s understandable that they may have personal preferences or dislikes when it comes to cooking, refusing to assist their mother—who is struggling—demonstrates a lack of empathy and support that is fundamental in family relationships. Family members should be willing to step up for one another, especially when someone is facing difficulties.

To further assert that the OP is at fault, they missed a valuable opportunity to foster connection and support through shared activities. Cooking together could have served not only as a practical solution but also as a way to bond and provide emotional comfort to their mother. By opting out completely, the OP not only let their mother down, but they also isolated themselves from potentially strengthening their relationship during a vulnerable time. This refusal to engage in a collaborative effort ultimately undermines the family unit and shows a lack of commitment to supporting each other in difficult circumstances.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the OP's decision not to cook may stem from valid personal boundaries rather than a lack of empathy. Everyone has different capacities for handling stress and emotional demands, and the OP may be prioritizing their mental health. By setting this boundary, they might be ensuring that they can engage with their family in other supportive and meaningful ways, rather than forcing themselves into a role that could lead to resentment or burnout.

A new concise argument for the OP not being at fault is that they have the right to prioritize their own well-being, especially in a family context where stress and illness are prevalent. By choosing not to cook, the OP acknowledges their limits and allows for healthier engagement with their family.

**YTA (You're The Asshole) Arguments:**
1. The OP failed to recognize the responsibilities and support expected in a family, especially during tough times when their mother is unwell.
2. Their refusal to help with cooking reflects a lack of empathy and undermines the mutual support that is crucial in family dynamics.
3. The OP missed opportunities for bonding and creating shared experiences that could strengthen their relationship with their mother.

After reviewing both sides, it seems that the NTA arguments provide a more nuanced understanding of the OP’s situation.

1oa9jv6,AITA I had my 21st birthday and some guy tried to break into my house,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa9jv6/aita_i_had_my_21st_birthday_and_some_guy_tried_to/,NTA,NTA,True,"So I turned 21 this week - my birthday was on the 15th and we hosted a party on the 18th. Th theme was 'dress as my favorite things' and I bought a karaoke machine for the party. I live in a student area where people are frequently hosting house parties, even then I made sure that our karaoke would not run past 11pm - as our council rules define quiet hours as between 11pm-7am. This was something I made sure that the loud parts of the party would stay between.  At about 8/9pm my friends started showing up we started doing our karaoke, at 10:05pm a neighbour I have never met before showed up at the door and was slamming on both the doorbell and the door, I opened the door thinking it was a friend. He then started screaming in my face about his babies not being able to sleep (he was 70/80) before I could apologise he tried to force his way into our house, stepping over our doormat - he only left when my boyfriend stepped in front of me. I know we were being loud, louder than parties normally in this area. we've handled our previous complaints with ease (the only ever other noise complaint I have had is for the flat above mine and I made the complainers banana bread to apologise).  We immediately turned off the music after he left - however I did end up having a panic attack from the way he yelled at me, and ended up calling 101 (the UK non emergency line) as I was shaken by the experience and that's what my mum said to do.   I now have a meeting with a police officer tomorrow, but don't know if I'm overacting or should have held the party at all?",,"While the original poster attempted to be considerate by ending the noise at 11 PM and hosting a themed party, they failed to take full responsibility for the impact of their actions on their neighbors. Hosting a loud karaoke party in a residential area, especially knowing that it could disturb others, shows a lack of awareness and respect for the community's needs. Rather than addressing potential noise issues proactively, they allowed the situation to escalate to the point where a neighbor felt compelled to confront them. This indicates a disregard for the well-being of those living nearby, making them at fault for the disruption caused.

Refuting the previous YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster did take steps to minimize disturbance by ending the noise at 11 PM, which is a reasonable time to conclude festivities in a residential area. They also chose a themed party, demonstrating a desire for fun and creativity rather than outright negligence towards their neighbors. 

Moreover, a new concise argument for the author not being at fault is that social gatherings are a normal part of community life, and the author likely assumed that a well-timed conclusion would suffice for the occasion. Unless there were explicit noise complaints prior to the party, it is unreasonable to expect individuals to completely abstain from celebrating in their own homes, especially when they make efforts to respect the time constraints of their neighbors. Thus, the original poster's actions were within the bounds of normal social behavior, and they shouldn't be deemed at fault for merely enjoying a special occasion.While it’s true that the original poster ended the noise at 11 PM, this does not absolve them of responsibility for the disturbance caused by hosting a loud karaoke party in a residential area. The fact remains that they chose to engage in an activity that is inherently noisy and disruptive, particularly late in the evening. Simply adhering to an arbitrary end time does not negate the impact of the noise that occurred beforehand. 

Furthermore, a new argument for the author being at fault is that they failed to communicate with their neighbors about the party beforehand. A simple heads-up could have gone a long way in fostering goodwill and understanding within the community. By not taking this step, the poster demonstrated a lack of consideration for their neighbors' living conditions and the potential for disruption, which ultimately contributed to the conflict. This oversight indicates a failure to acknowledge the shared nature of the residential environment, placing the responsibility squarely on the original poster.

Refuting the previous YTA argument, it's essential to consider that the original poster did take measures to minimize disruption by concluding the party at 11 PM, a reasonable time for social gatherings to end in residential areas. Additionally, hosting a themed party reflects an effort to create a joyful atmosphere rather than a blatant disregard for neighbors’ peace.

Moreover, a new argument for why the author is not at fault is that social gatherings are a normal part of community life, and it is reasonable to expect some level of noise during celebrations. Unless there were prior complaints or explicit agreements regarding noise levels, it is unreasonable to hold the original poster completely accountable for a temporary increase in noise during a special occasion. They acted within typical social norms, and their intentions were not malicious, suggesting that they should not be deemed at fault for merely enjoying a celebratory event.Refuting the previous argument that the original poster is not at fault, it's important to note that while they may have concluded the party at a reasonable hour, they still chose to host a loud karaoke event, which inherently risks disturbing neighbors, especially in a residential setting. The decision to hold such a noisy gathering without considering its potential impact on the surrounding community demonstrates a lack of foresight and responsibility.

A new concise argument for why the author is at fault is that they failed to proactively communicate with their neighbors about the party. By not informing them in advance, they missed an opportunity to foster understanding and mitigate any potential issues. This lack of consideration for their neighbors’ comfort and peace contributed to the conflict. Engaging with the community beforehand could have shown respect and prevented the disturbance, highlighting the author’s failure to prioritize neighborly relationships, which ultimately puts them at fault for the situation.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's crucial to recognize that the original poster did make an effort to conclude the noise at 11 PM, demonstrating an awareness of time constraints in a residential area. The choice to host a themed party, which is often seen as a fun and harmless way to celebrate, indicates that the poster was not acting out of malice or disregard for their neighbors.

A new argument for why the author is not at fault is that community norms can vary widely, and the poster likely assumed that a karaoke party would be an acceptable form of entertainment among friends. Unless there were explicit noise restrictions communicated by the neighbors or prior complaints about similar gatherings, it is unreasonable to expect the original poster to predict the level of disturbance their party might cause. Social gatherings are a natural part of community life, and it is not fair to place the entire burden of neighborly consideration on the host without prior dialogue or established expectations. Thus, the original poster should not be held fully accountable for the situation.Refuting the last argument that the original poster is not at fault, it's important to emphasize that while they may have concluded the party at a reasonable hour, they still chose to host a loud karaoke event in a residential area. This inherently risks disturbing neighbors, especially considering that noise can carry and create discomfort long before the official end time. The decision to engage in such a noisy activity indicates a lack of consideration for the potential impact on those living nearby.

A new argument for why the author is at fault is that they demonstrated a lack of awareness of their surroundings. By not checking in with neighbors before hosting the party, the author missed a crucial opportunity to gauge their comfort levels and address any potential concerns. This oversight reflects a failure to prioritize community relationships and shows a disregard for the shared living environment. Good neighbors communicate and seek to maintain harmony, and in this case, the original poster's lack of proactive engagement contributed to the conflict, placing them at fault for the disturbance caused.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the original poster did take steps to mitigate disturbance by concluding the party at 11 PM, which is a common time for social gatherings to wrap up in residential areas. Additionally, hosting a themed party reflects an intention to create a joyful atmosphere rather than disrupt the neighborhood.

A new argument for why the author is not at fault is that social gatherings are a normal part of community life, and it is reasonable to expect some level of noise during celebrations. Unless there were explicit noise complaints or previously established noise restrictions, it is unfair to hold the original poster entirely accountable for a temporary increase in noise. They acted within typical social norms and likely assumed that their celebration would be accepted by the community. Thus, the original poster should not be deemed at fault for simply enjoying a special occasion with friends.Refuting the last argument, it’s essential to acknowledge that while social gatherings are indeed a part of community life, the original poster chose to host a loud karaoke party, which is inherently disruptive, particularly in a residential area. The decision to engage in such a noisy activity without considering how it might affect neighbors demonstrates a lack of awareness and responsibility.

A new argument for why the author is at fault is that they neglected to consider the potential cumulative impact of noise on their neighbors, especially if similar gatherings had occurred in the past. Even if the party ended at 11 PM, the noise generated beforehand could have significantly disrupted the peace of the surrounding homes. This oversight reflects a failure to prioritize community harmony and respect for their neighbors' comfort, which is crucial in shared living environments. By not taking proactive steps to communicate or manage noise levels, the original poster contributed to the situation, ultimately placing them at fault for the disturbance.

Refuting the last argument, it's important to highlight that while the original poster did host a karaoke party, they made efforts to conclude the festivities at 11 PM, a time that is generally considered acceptable for social gatherings in residential areas. This shows an intention to be considerate of their neighbors' peace, rather than a blatant disregard for it.

A new argument for why the author is not at fault is that social gatherings are a common and expected part of community life, and people should have the freedom to celebrate special occasions without fear of backlash, provided they are not excessively disruptive. Unless there were prior noise complaints or a known pattern of disturbances from the poster, it is unreasonable to expect them to predict how their party might affect neighbors. The expectation of complete silence during celebrations can be unrealistic; thus, the original poster should not be held entirely responsible for the temporary noise, especially when they made efforts to keep it within reasonable hours.","{'score': 3, 'criteria': 'Some grounding but with a few unsupported claims.', 'supporting_evidence': ""The response recognizes attempts to mitigate noise by ending the party at 11 PM, but it also contains speculative statements about the host's awareness and responsibility, which are not explicitly supported by facts in the source material.""}","**Summary of Arguments:**

**YTA (You’re The A-hole) Arguments:**

2. Ending the noise at 11 PM does not absolve OP of responsibility for the earlier disturbance caused by the party.
3. OP failed to communicate with neighbors beforehand, missing an opportunity to foster goodwill and prevent conflict.
4. The choice to have a loud gathering indicates a disregard for the potential impact on others living nearby.
5. The cumulative impact of noise, even if it ends at a reasonable hour, could significantly disrupt neighbors' peace.

**NTA (Not The A-hole) Arguments:**
1. OP took steps to minimize disturbance by concluding the party at 11 PM, which is a reasonable time for festivities in residential areas.

5. People should have the freedom to enjoy celebrations without fear of backlash, provided they keep it within reasonable hours.

**Conclusion:**
The debate presents strong arguments from both sides, but the emphasis on social norms, reasonable celebration times, and the lack of prior complaints gives OP more leeway in this situation.

1oa92qz,AITA for telling my roommate not to clean the apartment at night,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa92qz/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_not_to_clean_the/,NTA,NTA,True,"I'm living in an apartment with two roommates, so we're three total. Each of us have their own room and we share a kitchen and a bathroom. One of my roommates came back from studying abroad for a year, so he is still often rearranging stuff in the apartment. I probably should mention that the roommate in question is neurodivergent with ADHD, so it is difficult for him to follow a regular schedule.   I sleep very lightly and react very negatively to noise while trying to sleep. Also I really value going to sleep ""early"" (earlier than my roommates that is, anything from 11pm-1am is usual for me) and getting at least eight hours of it. Because of this I've already had discussions with my roommates a few times, because they either don't mind noise or go to sleep very late. I've told them multiple times that it bothers me if they're being noisy at night.  So in this instance I was trying to sleep at 22:45 when I hear my roommate being really loud in the hallway, rearranging stuff and turning on the vacuum cleaner which woke me up instantly. I waited for a few minutes, but when I realized it would be a longer thing I went out of my room to confront him about it. I tried to ask nicely if he could try being more quiet and told him that I don't think it's okay to vaccume this late in the day because I want to sleep and it might bother the neighbours. He responded that he will try to be more quiet but also that he will continue vacuuming at some point this night. He told me that this is the only time he has the chance to do it and he really wants to clean the place. He insisted that his interest in cleaning up the place is just as legit as my interest in sleeping, so I should try to be more sympathetic to him.  We discussed it some more and eventually he did concede to do me a favour, but still thinks he's in the right. In the end I felt quite bad about it and wonder if I am ta for stopping my roommates from doing things that are important to them because of me wanting to go to sleep at a reasonable time.  Edit: for anyone interested, he still makes noise at night, vacuuming, assembling his furniture and so on even though I told him I'm not okay with it. He just doesn't ask me anymore.",,"The original poster is the AH because they are not taking into account the needs and circumstances of their neurodivergent roommate. While their need for sleep is valid, the roommate's struggle with time management and the urgency of cleaning upon returning from studying abroad should also be respected. Instead of fostering a collaborative living environment, the OP is prioritizing their own comfort without considering alternative solutions, such as establishing designated quiet hours or discussing a cleaning schedule that accommodates both parties. Flexibility and understanding are essential in shared living situations, and the OP’s approach lacks empathy for their roommate's challenges.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that the OP's need for sleep is valid, it’s important to recognize that the OP had already communicated their need for a quiet environment in advance. The roommate, aware of this, should have taken that into consideration before planning their cleaning spree late at night. The OP is not at fault for wanting to maintain their well-being by prioritizing rest, especially since they had previously established boundaries that the roommate chose to overlook.

New concise argument: The OP demonstrated consideration for their roommate's needs by allowing them to clean after their return from studying abroad. However, it is unreasonable for the roommate to disregard the OP's established need for sleep. The OP is not at fault because they are entitled to enforce their boundaries, especially when those boundaries relate to health and well-being.The OP is at fault because they failed to communicate effectively with their roommate about the timing and expectations surrounding the cleaning. While the OP had a valid need for sleep, they did not engage in a conversation to find a compromise or solution that would work for both of them. Instead of simply asserting their boundaries, they could have suggested alternative times for cleaning or a quieter approach to address the situation without conflict. By not facilitating an open dialogue, the OP contributed to the misunderstanding and tension in their living arrangement. A lack of collaboration in shared spaces ultimately leads to resentment and can disrupt the harmony of the household.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While the OP could have communicated more explicitly about their concerns, it’s important to note that they had already established their need for a quiet environment due to their sleep requirements. The onus was on the roommate to respect that boundary, especially since it was communicated in advance. The OP cannot be held entirely responsible for the roommate’s lack of consideration for the established agreement.

New concise argument: The OP is not at fault because they were acting within their rights to prioritize their health and well-being. They had already communicated their need for a quiet space for sleep, and it is unreasonable to expect them to compromise that for the roommate’s cleaning schedule, especially at such a late hour. The OP's need for rest is valid and should be respected in a shared living situation.The OP is at fault because they did not take the opportunity to engage in a constructive dialogue with their roommate before the cleaning occurred. While the OP communicated their need for sleep, they could have proactively discussed a cleaning schedule or alternative times for the roommate to tidy up, especially given the roommate's recent return from abroad. Instead of fostering understanding and collaboration, the OP chose to enforce their boundaries without seeking a compromise. This lack of communication led to unnecessary conflict and tension, indicating a failure to navigate shared living dynamics responsibly.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it is true that effective communication is vital in shared living situations, the OP had already established their boundaries regarding sleep and quiet time. The roommate was fully aware of the OP’s need for a peaceful environment and chose to disregard that in favor of their own schedule. The responsibility to respect those boundaries ultimately lies with the roommate, who failed to prioritize the OP's needs in this instance.

New concise argument: The OP is not at fault because they were simply asserting their right to a peaceful living environment, which is essential for their well-being. They had previously communicated their need for quiet during specific hours, and it is unreasonable to expect them to compromise their health for the sake of the roommate’s cleaning schedule. The OP's actions were justified in maintaining their boundaries, highlighting the importance of mutual respect in any shared living arrangement.The OP is at fault because they failed to address their roommate's needs in a collaborative manner, opting instead for a confrontational approach. While the OP had communicated the need for quiet due to their sleep schedule, they did not engage in a constructive conversation to find a compromise. For instance, they could have discussed an earlier cleaning time or suggested quieter methods. By not initiating a dialogue, the OP missed an opportunity to foster a more understanding living environment and instead escalated the situation. This lack of proactive communication demonstrates a failure to respect the roommate's circumstances and contributed to the conflict.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it's true that communication is essential in shared living situations, the OP had clearly communicated their need for a quiet environment prior to the roommate's late-night cleaning. The roommate had a responsibility to respect that boundary, especially since it was established beforehand. The OP's actions were not confrontational but rather a necessary assertion of their right to a peaceful living space, which the roommate chose to ignore.

New concise argument: The OP is not at fault because they were prioritizing their health and well-being, which is a legitimate concern in any living arrangement. They had already set clear boundaries regarding their need for sleep, and it is unreasonable to expect someone to sacrifice their rest for the sake of another's cleaning schedule. The OP acted within their rights to maintain their established boundaries, emphasizing the importance of respecting each other’s needs in a shared space.The OP is at fault because they did not approach the situation with empathy and understanding toward their roommate's circumstances. While the OP's need for sleep is valid, they could have engaged in a conversation to find a mutually agreeable solution. For instance, they could have suggested a specific time for cleaning that would not disrupt their rest or agreed on a quieter cleaning method. By failing to communicate and collaborate, the OP missed an opportunity to foster a more respectful and cooperative living environment, ultimately contributing to the tension. This lack of flexibility indicates a disregard for the shared nature of their living situation and the roommate's needs.

Refuting the last YTA argument: While it is true that empathy and understanding are essential in shared living situations, the OP had already communicated their need for a quiet environment well in advance. The roommate's decision to clean late at night, despite knowing about the OP’s sleep needs, shows a lack of respect for those boundaries. The OP's assertion of their right to a peaceful living space was not confrontational but rather a necessary measure to protect their well-being.

1oa8dtg,AITA for not calling/texting my friends everyday even if though we work together?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oa8dtg/aita_for_not_callingtexting_my_friends_everyday/,NTA,NTA,True,So recently me and a few work buddies had an altercation about whether two male friends need to text/call each other everyday. They feel as if I’m not a friend to them regarding I rarely text/call them outside of work even though we spend a lot of time talking at work. I have explained to them that I’m not much of a texter or caller but they still think as friends we should be calling/texting everyday. I feel as if it is childish for them to expect that. I feel like those are more relationship standards than they are friendship standards. AITA?,,"While it's true that not everyone communicates in the same way, maintaining friendships often requires effort outside of shared environments, like work. By not reaching out to your friends outside of work, you may be sending the message that you don't value the relationship as much as they do. Friendships, like any relationship, thrive on mutual effort, and your reluctance to engage beyond work could be perceived as a lack of commitment or care. Therefore, it's reasonable for your friends to feel hurt or neglected, making you the YTA in this situation.

While I understand the concern about communication and effort in friendships, it's important to recognize that everyone has different capacities and circumstances that influence how they maintain their relationships. The original poster may have been navigating personal challenges, such as increased work responsibilities or mental health issues, that limit their ability to reach out. This context matters significantly; it doesn’t mean they don’t value their friendships. 

Furthermore, friendships should not be solely based on one party's ability to initiate contact. A healthy friendship is reciprocal, and if the friends have not made an effort to reach out either, it can create an imbalance. The original poster is not at fault for prioritizing their own well-being and should not be held solely responsible for maintaining the friendship. 

In conclusion, it is crucial to recognize that friendships require understanding and flexibility from all parties involved, and the original poster's situation should be viewed through that lens.While it's true that everyone has different capacities for maintaining friendships, the original poster's lack of initiative to reach out to friends outside of work indicates a deeper issue in valuing those relationships. Friendships are built on mutual effort, and by not reciprocating outreach, the poster may unintentionally convey disinterest or neglect. 

Moreover, the argument that personal challenges justify the lack of communication does not absolve the responsibility of maintaining connections. Friends should ideally check in on one another, especially during tough times. If the poster is not making any effort to engage, it could be perceived as inconsiderate, especially if their friends are reaching out and not receiving a response.

In essence, the original poster is at fault for not prioritizing the friendships that seem to be important to others, and they should take accountability for the impact their inaction has had on those relationships.

While it's understandable that communication styles and personal circumstances vary, the argument that the original poster is at fault for not reaching out significantly overlooks the broader context of friendships. Friendships are not solely the responsibility of one person; they thrive on mutual effort and understanding. If the original poster was facing personal challenges, such as increased work demands or mental health issues, it’s reasonable to expect that their friends would also recognize and respect these boundaries rather than placing blame solely on the poster.

Additionally, assuming that the poster’s lack of outreach equates to disinterest ignores the possibility that friendships can endure periods of less communication without signaling an end to the relationship. It’s crucial for friends to also initiate contact and demonstrate understanding when one is going through a tough time. Therefore, rather than placing the entirety of the responsibility on the original poster, we should consider the reciprocal nature of friendship and acknowledge that it requires effort from all parties involved. 

In conclusion, the original poster is not at fault; instead, this situation highlights the need for mutual understanding and effort in maintaining friendships.While it’s true that personal circumstances can impact one’s ability to maintain friendships, the original poster is indeed at fault for not making any effort to reach out to their friends outside of work. Friendships require active participation from both sides, and when one party consistently fails to engage, it can lead to feelings of neglect and resentment.

The last argument that personal challenges justify the lack of communication overlooks the fact that friendships are often strengthened through support during tough times. By not reaching out at all, the original poster may unintentionally convey that they do not value these relationships or the efforts their friends are making. 

A concise argument for the original poster being at fault is that friendships thrive on reciprocity; by failing to initiate contact or respond to their friends’ outreach, the original poster is not fulfilling their part in the relationship. This lack of engagement can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings, making it reasonable for their friends to feel unappreciated. In essence, the poster should recognize their role in fostering these friendships and take accountability for their inaction.

While it’s important to acknowledge that personal circumstances can affect one’s ability to maintain friendships, the original poster is not at fault for the situation at hand. The last argument suggests that the poster should reach out more, but it fails to consider the emotional labor involved in friendships. If the poster has been facing significant personal challenges, it’s understandable that they may not have the capacity to initiate contact. 

Furthermore, friendships should encompass understanding and support from all sides. If the friends truly value the relationship, they should also make an effort to reach out and check in. It places an unfair burden on the original poster to be the sole initiator, especially if they are dealing with their own difficulties.

In conclusion, the original poster is not at fault; they may simply be navigating their own challenges, and it’s essential for friendships to have mutual understanding and effort rather than placing the onus entirely on one person.While it’s true that personal circumstances can affect one’s ability to maintain friendships, the original poster is indeed at fault for their lack of initiative in reaching out. The argument suggesting that their friends should understand their situation overlooks the vital role that mutual effort plays in any relationship. Friendships require active participation, and when one party consistently fails to engage, it can lead to feelings of neglect and resentment.

Moreover, the idea that the poster's personal challenges justify their inaction doesn’t fully address the responsibility that comes with friendships. If the original poster has friends who are attempting to connect, it’s essential for them to reciprocate that effort, even if it feels difficult. Ignoring outreach from friends can signal disinterest, which can harm those relationships over time.

A new argument for the original poster being at fault is that friendships are a two-way street. By not taking the initiative to reach out, the original poster not only risks losing valuable connections but also places an unfair emotional burden on their friends who may be left feeling unappreciated. Taking accountability for their part in the friendship dynamic is crucial, and it’s reasonable for their friends to feel hurt by the lack of engagement.

While it’s true that personal circumstances can affect one’s ability to maintain friendships, the argument that the original poster is at fault for not reaching out holds water. The idea that friends should understand and make allowances for someone’s struggles does not excuse the responsibility that comes with nurturing relationships. Friendships require mutual effort, and consistently failing to engage can lead to feelings of neglect and disappointment.

Moreover, the notion that the original poster’s challenges justify their lack of communication overlooks the fact that friendships can provide support during tough times. Instead of waiting for friends to reach out, the poster could benefit from acknowledging their friends' efforts and reciprocating, even in small ways, to maintain those connections.

A strong argument for the original poster being at fault is that friendships thrive on reciprocity. If the poster is not actively participating in the relationship, they risk creating an imbalance that can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. By not reaching out, the original poster is neglecting their role in fostering a healthy friendship dynamic, which can understandably lead their friends to feel unappreciated or sidelined.While it’s true that personal circumstances can affect one’s ability to maintain friendships, the original poster is indeed at fault for their lack of initiative in reaching out. The argument suggesting that their friends should understand their situation overlooks the essential nature of mutual effort in any relationship. Friendships require active participation, and when one party consistently fails to engage, it can lead to feelings of neglect and disappointment.

Moreover, the idea that personal challenges justify the original poster's inaction does not excuse the responsibility they have to their friends. If those friends are actively trying to connect, it’s crucial for the poster to reciprocate that effort, even if it feels challenging. Ignoring outreach from friends can signal disinterest, which can ultimately harm those relationships.

A new argument for the original poster being at fault is that friendships are inherently reciprocal; they thrive when both parties engage and support each other. By not taking the initiative to reach out, the original poster may inadvertently communicate that they do not value the friendship as much as their friends do. This lack of engagement can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings, making it reasonable for their friends to feel neglected. Therefore, the original poster should take accountability for their role in this dynamic and recognize the importance of staying connected, especially when friends are making an effort to reach out.

While it's understandable that personal circumstances can influence one's ability to maintain friendships, the original poster is not at fault. The argument that friends should initiate contact overlooks the need for a balanced effort in any relationship. Friends who truly value each other should be able to communicate openly about their expectations and feelings, rather than placing the onus entirely on one person.

In addition, it's crucial to recognize that friendships can endure periods of less communication without signaling an end to the relationship. If the original poster was dealing with personal challenges, they might not have had the emotional capacity to reach out, and their friends should ideally understand and support them during this time.

A new argument for the original poster not being at fault is that friendships should be based on understanding and compassion. If the friends have not made a concerted effort to reach out themselves, it indicates a lack of mutual engagement. This dynamic suggests that the responsibility for maintaining the friendship lies with all parties involved, not just the original poster. Therefore, they should not be held solely accountable for the perceived distance in the relationship.","{'score': 2, 'criteria': 'The response provides minimal grounding, relying on subjective interpretations rather than factual support.', 'supporting_evidence': 'While the response discusses friendship dynamics and offers perspectives, it lacks concrete factual references to support its claims, making the grounding unclear and primarily opinion-based.'}","**Summary of Arguments:**

**YTA (You're the Asshole):**
1. Friendships require mutual effort, and by not reaching out outside of work, the original poster (OP) may be perceived as disinterested or neglectful.
2. The lack of initiative on the OP's part can lead to feelings of hurt and resentment among friends who are making an effort to maintain the relationship.
3. Personal challenges do not absolve the OP of their responsibility to engage and reciprocate outreach from friends, especially during tough times.

**NTA (Not the Asshole):**
1. Everyone has different capacities for maintaining friendships, and the OP may be dealing with personal issues that hinder their ability to reach out.
2. Friendships should encompass understanding and support from all parties, which means friends should also make an effort to check in and communicate.
3. Friendships can endure periods of less communication without signaling a decline, and it is unfair to place the entire burden of maintaining the relationship on one party.

**Evaluation of Arguments:**
The YTA side emphasizes the importance of mutual effort and the consequences of inaction in friendships, highlighting that lack of engagement can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. Conversely, the NTA argument focuses on understanding personal circumstances and the reciprocal nature of friendships, arguing that one party should not bear the full responsibility for maintaining the relationship.

Both sides present valid points, but the NTA perspective emphasizes the importance of compassion and understanding in friendships, especially during challenging times. It recognizes that friendships can withstand periods of less communication without indicating a lack of care.

**Conclusion:**
Given the weight of the NTA arguments regarding the need for empathy and mutual engagement, it is reasonable to conclude that the OP is not solely at fault.
