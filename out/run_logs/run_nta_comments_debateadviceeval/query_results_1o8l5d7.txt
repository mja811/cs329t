=== QUERY ===
I’m 20 years old and my mom has been an addict for as long as i can remember.
When i turned 18 she lost 1000 dollars a month from her social security so it
was a big change. I finally have a part time job and make about 400 dollars each
check (give or take bcz i don’t have a set amount of hours.) My mom is demanding
half of every check and i don’t want to give it to her as she is an opioid
addict. And quite frankly has never been good with money. She already spends my
160 that i get on my food card every month by ordering name brand groceries and
so much meat and fruit that goes to waste.   On top of that my friend who lives
with us also pays her rent. My mom never asked for me to pay rent until 1. she
got her other pain meds cut off and 2. when my friend moved in and started
paying her rent.   My mom also went bankrupt for the second time a few months
ago. She is already talking about getting a loan for a car while her license is
also suspended. I don’t feel comfy paying a drug addict that i know very well
half of my pay check.   I get that she is in pain and has back issues and
surgeries coming up and  she really does want to get clean but im tired of
seeing no progress and trusting her word. Not even two days latter my friend
gave her 400 she was coming to me saying she had no money for cigs or umo fare.
She gets mad when i talk about moving and saying why would i want to pay rent
somewhere else and it’s gonna be more. I know it will be more but giving the
living situation i am in current, it’s not worth a dime.   On top of it all i
found out that i am pregnant so i really can’t be living here and like this nor
am i gonna be giving her money that i will need more than ever to someone who
doesn’t know how to budget and is just gonna spend it on drugs. Every morning
day and night i have to check on her making sure shes not folded like a lawn
chair. I can’t take care of a kid and her.   Edit: In no way do I plan on
staying here for very long especially if she doesn’t start taking big steps very
soon. My bf really wants to be here for me and step up and get better job so we
can get our own place. I am gonna ask my boss to move up to full time so I can
better prepare for my next steps aswell. I know i am not responsible but I never
needed to be before and I am gonna do everything I can to make this life worth
living for me and my kid.   And tbh all i am seeing in the comments is stuff
that i am fundamentally aware of, so it’s more so just solidifying stuff i
already know and will need to do. So everyone telling me this is a bad situation
and that i am irresponsible. I KNOW THAT, that is why things need to change and
I want to change them FAST.   At this point it’s not even about the rent money
or if i am the asshole. i just wanted to hear everything i already know so i
don’t feel like im just abandoning her for no reason. It’s so unfair that i am
the one that was left with this, so proud of my sibling for getting out but god
this just sucks all around.   I’ll be sure to update yall when i make it out✌️

I have a long time friend who has struggled  financially  for, well, forever.
Background:I've always  been an empathetic  person, and I'm Not rich- but I've
always had a strong work ethic,I budget, make ends meet, and try to save a bit
to support my family. My friend has been on govt assistance for the majority  of
our lives with her children and hasnt worked in atleast 17years. I have always
just given her money- 20 here,50 there,100,bought tires for her car,stuff for
her kids,etc.  About 3 months ago, I had saved up and spent thousands to drive
across the country and bring her and 2 of her adult  children into to my home,
in an effort to raise her some $ to get her  out of the hole she seems to
forever be in. At the very least, make some memories  and give her some hope.
My goal was to work extra hard, pay her to babysit and raise her atleast $1000
to go home with. I exceeded  that goal, and raised her $1800 in a month. It was
a costly endeavor  on my part, I almost completely  depleted  my savings paying
for Everything, but I felt it was worth it. That is until she told me a few days
before her return back, she had no $. I paid her through an app,and paid for
literally  everything  while she was here, including  her trip home. She was
asking me for $ the day after she left, and has continued to since. Thing is, I
feel bad now because  she is in a hard place as always,but with the shut down
she is desperate. But I cant really give anymore, and I am now recieving the
cold shoulder. Aitah for not helping financially when she is starving?

F20 i, still live with my mother and step dad. I am currently in college and i
do have a job that i go to on weekends and days when i finish college early.  I
make enough to survive on my necessity and necessity for my hedgehog , that i
took in and decided to take care of it myself. I make usually around minimum
wage or even less as a student but its enough. Not enough tho for me to have my
own home. I also have a brother 18M who moved out right away to his girlfriend
house. He doesnt have a job yet and lives off what they can scrap up from past
jobs. Week ago my brother called my mother asking her for 100$. Of course my
mother , who would do anything for her child , she does , but instead of them
buying groceries or necessities , they add that money for the new electric
"skiro". She didnt mind tho , she only added that he has to return the money
when available to do so.this month i didnt get payed myself , beacuse the
company and student workforce company had complications through system and money
was unable to transfer through so they asked me to wait till next month. I had
some saved money so i didnt complain. But now after paying half of my shared
bills, food and animals care i am completly out. Last night i asked her if she
can lend me 20$. You know for my hedghog and so i could have 5$ for emergencies
in college. She started huffing and complaining about it , making a whole deal
about it like i asked her for 200$ instead of 20. I nicely explained how am
completly without any , and my hedgehog still needs food and wooden palletes for
his cage. And that in two weeks ill return whole 20$..she didnt listen ,
throwing a fit and telling me "you are old enough to survive on your own and if
you need money then go start asking for in the streets". I was hurt , and i got
pissed. I told her how many times i lend her money so she could go to mountains
and drink or buy herself clothes. How many times i had to take care of her  ,
necessary or not and sometimes she didnt even returned it. I told her it was
unfair that she could still lend that much to my brother while she cant even
lend me 20 for necessaties. I barely ever asked for money. And i always returned
it. We got into a huge fight through , and i yelled , talking about her drinking
problems in the past and how i had to take care of her as a kid , how many times
i was quiet when she met another man behind my step dads back. How she always
prioritized my brother over me. She was hurt by this truth and i felt bad for
yelling at my own mother but am i the AITA??

I (17F) am still in high school and live in an area where it’s really hard to
get a job. I don’t have a car because there’s no money for driving school.
Recently, my mom (37) told me she’s not going to buy food anymore because “we’re
all grown” and everyone has to buy their own food. This started after she asked
my brother (19), who works and also gets to use her car to get to work, to give
her $100 to buy food since we rely on SNAP and the government shut it down. He
refused, so she decided she’s not buying food for anyone and that everyone has
to fend for themselves.  I completely lost it when she told me this and said,
“Why did you even have kids? Why have kids if you’re poor and just end up
regretting them?” She always talks about how we ruined her life, so I just
snapped. I asked why, at 17, broke and having to take care of her own family,
she decided to have kids anyway. Kids that she trauma dumps on every chance she
gets. She always lets my brother have his way and then gets mad at the rest of
us.   In the heat of the argument, I also told her that if she really didn’t
want us, she should’ve just aborted us or never had us in the first place. I
said that if she really wanted to punish someone, it should be my brother, since
he’s the one who refused to help in the first place. She went on to say, “ I
should have” “You guys are grown. I already raised you. I already raised you.”
I know what I said was rude and disrespectful, but it’s just so hard not to be
when I’m this angry and hurt.  [ EDIT: MY MOM AND I SPOKE AGAIN ABOUT THE
MATTER. SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS JUST STRESSED AND THAT SHE ACTUALLY DIDNT MEAN IT.
SHE FOUND SOME HELP WITH OUR FOOD SITUATION FOR NOW AND I TOLD HER ABOUT THE
FOOD BANKS]

My name is mark , 26 years old , I finally got my own apartment last year after
saving for years. It’s a small one-bedroom place, nothing fancy, but it’s mine
and it’s the first time I’ve ever really had privacy. My mom , she is 52 years
old recently broke up with her boyfriend and had to move out of his house. She
called me crying, saying she didn’t have anywhere to go and asked if she could
stay for a few weeks. Of course, I said yes, she’s my mom. But it’s been four
months. She hasn’t looked for a new place, doesn’t help with groceries, and has
started treating my apartment like it’s hers. She rearranged my furniture, keeps
commenting on my food choices, and even tried to throw away some of my stuff
because it looked old. I’ve gently brought it up a few times, but every time I
do, she gets emotional and says things like, “Wow, after all I did for you, now
you’re kicking me out?” or “You’d let your own mother be homeless?” Last week,
she invited two of her friends over while I was at work without even asking. I
came home to people sitting on my couch drinking wine. That’s when I told her we
needed to set a deadline for her to move out. She cried and said I’ve changed
and that she can’t believe how cold I’ve become. My sister thinks I’m being
heartless, but she lives two hours away and isn’t offering to take Mom in
either. I love my mom, but I just can’t live like this anymore. I’m starting to
feel like a guest in my own home. AITA for asking my mom to move out even though
she says she has nowhere to go?

Title: AITA for not wanting to drive my friend around anymore?

I (22F) let my best friend move in with me and my mom almost a year ago. She
didn’t have the best upbringing and her parents never taught her to drive or
really do anything, so we let her move in (rent free) so she could get a stable
job and get a car. Since moving in she got a job pretty quickly at Panera bread,
but she barely gets any pay or hours. My agreement with my mom when she moved in
was that my friend would mostly be self sufficient, taking public transit or
uber and we give her rides when we can until she gets a car. This is because my
mom and I both work full time.  Lately i’ve been feeling a bit resentful towards
her because of her lack of progress since moving here and I feel as though an
expectation is always placed on me to give her a ride if i’m at home. These past
few months we’ve really been stressing to her that she needs to find a job other
than Panera, although she’s already saved up a couple thousand, she needs to get
a job where she can pay for a car and other things like insurance. She acts as
though she wants to find a better job, but i feel like she could definitely be
putting a little more effort in. She says she’s calling places but I don’t know
if it’s true. She seems complacent with where she’s working now most of the
time.  But the thing that bothers me the most is that I pretty much have become
responsible for giving her rides most of the time. She stopped taking public
transport early on because she said the homeless people would bother her which i
get, and ubers can be expensive. But i work 6 days a week and my one day off
pretty much consists of making sure she gets to and from work. and i always have
to get up extra early on the days i do work to take her. My mom doesn’t get to
help out much because she goes to work at 5. She used to ride with my mom some
mornings when she’d go in early but now she’s completely been depending on me.
Also my resentment has come from how she’s treated me lately when i tried to lay
a boundary down. One morning she had to go in at 7 and she had previously asked
me to take her, but that night i realized how physically exhausted I was and I
needed one day where i didn’t have to get up early so I asked if she could ride
with my mom the next morning and wait, she got passive aggressive, and then went
in her room and slammed the door. Then two days ago i picked her up from work
after I got off and she asked me to take her to goodwill. I said “i’m really
tired right now can i take you tomorrow?” and she said “it’s fine” and got
snippy again. I asked her why she was acting that way and she said “I feel like
i have to force you to take me places” I told her that wasn’t true i just didn’t
feel like it at the time. I genuinely just feel like being depended on so much
for a whole year has made me really resentful and i don’t want to hang with her
at all most of the time.
