--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: My bf &amp; I recently moved in
together&amp; are having a bonfire tn with a few of his friends. His ex roommate
has been dating this girl on&amp;off the past year or so. Ive had minimal
interactions w her but everytime ive seen her in person she says nothing to me
unless I say hi first then shell say hi. Shes told my bfs roommate from the get
go that shes worried he wants to date me&amp;that im flirting w him. Both my
bf&amp; his room mate know this isnt true. My bf and I have a really good
relationship&amp; theres never been attraction or flirtation between me&amp;his
room mate or any1 else for that matter  Room mates gf has messaged me several
times on fb telling me she knows im attracted to her bf &amp; that I exclude her
by not saying hi when I see her(shes referencing a time when she didnt hear me
say hi&amp; found it rude). She doesnt believe me or my bf when we tell her im
not attracted to her bf. She also asked me to stop talking to her bf &amp; i
told her im not going to ignore him when im at my bfs house &amp; his rm-mate
starts talking to both of us.   She even snooped so far back on my fb &amp;
found a post I shared 10 or so years ago &amp; sent it to her bf w no context,
asking him if he liked it&amp;when he said yeah she told him i had posted it(It
wasnt even my original post, i just shared smthing). Her mssges&amp;stalking my
fb were so anxiety inducing at one point I blocked her. She then found me on
insta&amp;sent me a message telling me i was petty for blocking her,which I
didnt even notice until she screen shot it, sent it to my bf&amp;then blocked
him I unblocked her cause I felt bad and to explain why id blocked her in the
first place Also she wont say a single thing to me in person &amp;ive invited
her to hang w us several times but she never comes  Recently she &amp;her bf
broke up. Its happened a couple times &amp; im not super close w my bfs rm-mate
so I didnt think much of it until she sent me a message on fb telling me they
broke up&amp; asking me if I could find him someone else to date. This is like
within a week of them breaking up. I found this really weird and it made me even
more anxious. I responded by telling her my bf, who was still living w him,
could check on him&amp; left it at that  That brings us to the present. my bf
moved in last week &amp; we invited his ex room mate over for this bon fire. I
didnt think the gf would be a problem bc they arent 2gether but today he asked
if she could come with. my bf &amp; I both said no. He said this made her sad
&amp; he might not come  I really dont want her at my hosue. Shes made me so
anxious &amp; it honestly makes me feel crazy that she even asked to come w
after everything My bf is more chill abt her coming over but hes also supportive
of me not wanting to see her  AITA? Should I let her come over? I feel bad that
my bfs friend isnt gonna come now &amp; im worried shes gonna isolate him from
his friends esp if hes living alone now

Opposing side:

YTA because by not allowing your boyfriend's friend's girlfriend to attend the
bonfire, you are prioritizing your personal discomfort over the social dynamics
and friendships of those involved. While it's understandable to feel anxious due
to her behavior, your refusal to include her excludes not only her but also your
boyfriend's friend, potentially isolating him and harming their relationship. It
would be more mature to create a welcoming environment, especially since she's
not currently in a relationship with the roommate, rather than letting past
interactions dictate your decisions.

In response to the last YTA argument, it's important to recognize that the
original poster's feelings of discomfort are valid and deserve consideration.
Social dynamics can be complex, and if the presence of this individual
significantly impacts the original poster's ability to enjoy the gathering, it
is reasonable for them to set boundaries to protect their own emotional well-
being.   Additionally, the original poster is not at fault because they are
entitled to curate their social environment. If they feel that allowing this
person to attend would lead to tension or discomfort for themselves or their
guests, it is their prerogative to make that choice. Creating a positive
atmosphere for everyone involved should take precedence, and sometimes that
means making difficult decisions about who is invited.

YTA because you are prioritizing your personal discomfort over the social
dynamics and friendships of those involved. Refusing to invite your boyfriend's
friend's girlfriend, despite her not being in a relationship with the roommate
anymore, creates unnecessary tension and could alienate your boyfriend's friend.
Rather than fostering an inclusive atmosphere, you're choosing to exclude
someone based on past interactions. It's crucial to recognize that personal
boundaries are important, but they should not come at the expense of others'
relationships and feelings. Being able to engage with people you may not fully
like is part of growing socially, and it’s important to consider how your
actions affect those around you.

In response to the last YTA argument, it's essential to understand that the
original poster's feelings and boundaries are valid. While social dynamics can
be complicated, the original poster has the right to prioritize their own
comfort in social situations. If the presence of the boyfriend's friend's
girlfriend is likely to create discomfort or tension due to past interactions,
it is reasonable for the original poster to set limits on who they want in their
space.  Moreover, the original poster is not at fault because they are looking
out for the overall vibe of their gathering. A social event should be enjoyable
for all participants, and if including someone who causes anxiety or discomfort
would detract from that enjoyment, it's within the original poster's rights to
make that decision. Creating a positive atmosphere is paramount, and sometimes
that means being selective about who is invited, especially when past
experiences inform current feelings.

YTA because you're allowing past discomfort to dictate your actions in a way
that can harm your boyfriend's social relationships. While it's understandable
to feel uneasy about the presence of someone you have negative feelings towards,
refusing to invite the boyfriend's friend's girlfriend creates unnecessary
tension and can alienate others within the friend group. Your choice to exclude
her not only impacts her but also your boyfriend's friend, who might feel caught
in the middle. A more constructive approach would be to address your feelings
directly or find ways to coexist, rather than making unilateral decisions that
affect the social dynamics of the group. By prioritizing your own discomfort
over the relationships of those around you, you're not fostering a healthy
social environment.

In response to the last YTA argument, it's crucial to recognize that the
original poster's feelings and boundaries are valid and deserve respect. While
social dynamics can be complex, the original poster is not at fault for
prioritizing their emotional well-being. If the presence of the boyfriend's
friend's girlfriend would lead to discomfort or anxiety due to past
interactions, it is entirely reasonable for the original poster to set
boundaries for their own space.  Furthermore, the original poster's decision to
exclude this individual is not just about personal discomfort; it's about
creating a positive atmosphere for everyone involved. If they believe that
inviting her would disrupt the gathering and negatively impact the overall vibe,
they are justified in their choice. It's important to consider that social
gatherings should be enjoyable for all participants, and sometimes that means
making difficult decisions to ensure a harmonious environment. Ultimately, the
original poster is acting in a way that seeks to protect the enjoyment of the
gathering, which is a valid and responsible stance.

YTA because you're letting your personal discomfort overshadow the social
dynamics of your boyfriend's friend group. While it's understandable to feel
uneasy about someone based on past interactions, excluding the boyfriend's
friend's girlfriend from the bonfire impacts not just her but also your
boyfriend's friend. This exclusion could create tension and strain relationships
within the group. Rather than fostering a welcoming environment, you're
prioritizing your own feelings at the expense of others' social connections. A
more mature approach would be to find ways to coexist or communicate your
concerns rather than making a decision that could alienate others. By doing so,
you would be promoting a healthier social dynamic rather than allowing your
discomfort to dictate the situation.

In response to the last YTA argument, it's important to emphasize that the
original poster's feelings and boundaries are not only valid but also crucial
for maintaining a healthy social environment. While it may seem like a simple
matter of inclusion, the original poster has the right to prioritize their own
comfort and well-being in social situations, especially if past interactions
with the boyfriend's friend's girlfriend have been negative.  Moreover, the
original poster is not at fault for wanting to create a positive atmosphere for
their gathering. If they believe that inviting someone who has caused them
discomfort could disrupt the enjoyment of the event for themselves and their
guests, it's reasonable to set that boundary. Social gatherings should be
enjoyable for everyone involved, and it's entirely appropriate for the original
poster to make decisions that protect the overall vibe of the event. In this
context, their choice is a proactive effort to ensure that the gathering remains
a positive experience for all attendees, and that is a valid stance to take.

YTA because you are prioritizing your own discomfort over the well-being of the
group and potentially straining your boyfriend's friendships. While it's
understandable to feel uneasy about inviting someone with whom you have had
negative experiences, your decision to exclude the boyfriend's friend's
girlfriend can create unnecessary tension and lead to feelings of exclusion
within the friend group.   Instead of fostering a welcoming environment, you are
allowing your feelings to dictate who can participate in social gatherings,
which can alienate others and damage relationships. It's important to recognize
that social situations often require us to navigate uncomfortable dynamics and
engage with people we may not fully like. A more mature response would be to
address your concerns directly with your boyfriend or find ways to coexist
during the event, rather than making decisions that could negatively impact the
social fabric of your collective friendships.

In response to the last YTA argument, it's essential to recognize that the
original poster's feelings and boundaries are valid and deserve respect. While
it’s true that social dynamics can be complex, the original poster is not at
fault for prioritizing their own emotional well-being in this situation.
Moreover, the original poster is justified in their decision because they have
the right to curate their social environment. If the presence of the boyfriend's
friend's girlfriend would significantly impact their comfort or enjoyment of the
gathering, it is entirely reasonable to set that boundary. Social events should
be enjoyable for everyone involved, and sometimes that means making tough
decisions about who is invited based on past experiences. By choosing not to
include someone who has previously caused discomfort, the original poster is
taking steps to ensure a positive atmosphere for themselves and their guests,
which is a completely legitimate stance to take.

girlfriend to attend the bonfire.  2. This exclusion can create unnecessary
tension and alienate the boyfriend's friend, negatively affecting their
relationship.  3. A more mature approach would involve finding ways to coexist
with people who might cause discomfort rather than excluding them based on past
interactions.  4. The poster's actions do not foster a healthy social
environment and can damage relationships within the friend group.  **NTA
Arguments:** 1. The OP's feelings of discomfort are valid and should be
respected; they have the right to set boundaries to protect their emotional
well-being. 2. If the presence of the boyfriend's friend's girlfriend would
significantly impact their enjoyment of the gathering, it is reasonable for them
to exclude her. 3. The decision to curate their social environment is justified,
especially if past interactions with the individual have been negative and could
disrupt the atmosphere of the gathering. 4. The OP is making a proactive choice
to ensure a positive experience for themselves and other guests rather than

debate, the NTA arguments present a strong case for the original poster's right
to set boundaries based on past experiences that have caused them discomfort.
The YTA arguments largely focus on the impact of the OP's decision on others,
but they fail to adequately address the validity of the OP's feelings.
Ultimately, the emphasis on emotional well-being and the right to create a
comfortable social environment tips the scale in favor of NTA.  **Winner: NTA**

- It's important for you to prioritize your emotional well-being; if having the
boyfriend's friend's girlfriend at the bonfire causes you significant
discomfort, it’s reasonable to set boundaries for the gathering. - Given your
past negative interactions with this individual, it’s valid to consider how her
presence may affect not only your experience but also that of other attendees. -
Communicate your decision clearly and respectfully to the group, making it known
that your choice stems from a place of self-care rather than exclusion or
judgment of the girlfriend herself. - If possible, propose a separate
opportunity for socializing that includes everyone. This can help maintain
friendships while also respecting your comfort level. - Consider discussing with
your boyfriend and other close friends the importance of your boundaries up
front, which can help them understand and support your decision without feeling
caught in the middle. - Be mindful that your feelings are valid, and you don’t
owe anyone participation in your social gatherings if it compromises your well-
being; stand firm in your choice while remaining open to dialogue with the group
about it.
