--- AI Debate Transcript --- Topic: I’m 20 years old and my mom has been an
addict for as long as i can remember. When i turned 18 she lost 1000 dollars a
month from her social security so it was a big change. I finally have a part
time job and make about 400 dollars each check (give or take bcz i don’t have a
set amount of hours.) My mom is demanding half of every check and i don’t want
to give it to her as she is an opioid addict. And quite frankly has never been
good with money. She already spends my 160 that i get on my food card every
month by ordering name brand groceries and so much meat and fruit that goes to
waste.   On top of that my friend who lives with us also pays her rent. My mom
never asked for me to pay rent until 1. she got her other pain meds cut off and
2. when my friend moved in and started paying her rent.   My mom also went
bankrupt for the second time a few months ago. She is already talking about
getting a loan for a car while her license is also suspended. I don’t feel comfy
paying a drug addict that i know very well half of my pay check.   I get that
she is in pain and has back issues and surgeries coming up and  she really does
want to get clean but im tired of seeing no progress and trusting her word. Not
even two days latter my friend gave her 400 she was coming to me saying she had
no money for cigs or umo fare.   She gets mad when i talk about moving and
saying why would i want to pay rent somewhere else and it’s gonna be more. I
know it will be more but giving the living situation i am in current, it’s not
worth a dime.   On top of it all i found out that i am pregnant so i really
can’t be living here and like this nor am i gonna be giving her money that i
will need more than ever to someone who doesn’t know how to budget and is just
gonna spend it on drugs. Every morning day and night i have to check on her
making sure shes not folded like a lawn chair. I can’t take care of a kid and
her.   Edit: In no way do I plan on staying here for very long especially if she
doesn’t start taking big steps very soon. My bf really wants to be here for me
and step up and get better job so we can get our own place. I am gonna ask my
boss to move up to full time so I can better prepare for my next steps aswell. I
know i am not responsible but I never needed to be before and I am gonna do
everything I can to make this life worth living for me and my kid.   And tbh all
i am seeing in the comments is stuff that i am fundamentally aware of, so it’s
more so just solidifying stuff i already know and will need to do. So everyone
telling me this is a bad situation and that i am irresponsible. I KNOW THAT,
that is why things need to change and I want to change them FAST.   At this
point it’s not even about the rent money or if i am the asshole. i just wanted
to hear everything i already know so i don’t feel like im just abandoning her
for no reason. It’s so unfair that i am the one that was left with this, so
proud of my sibling for getting out but god this just sucks all around.   I’ll
be sure to update yall when i make it out✌️

Opposing side:

The original poster is at fault because, despite their mother's struggles with
addiction and financial instability, they have a moral obligation to support
their parent to some extent, especially when living under the same roof. While
it's understandable to be concerned about how the money will be used, completely
refusing to contribute to household expenses can exacerbate the situation and
increase stress for both parties. Instead of focusing solely on their own needs,
the original poster could find a way to set boundaries while still helping their
mother in her time of need, fostering a healthier environment for both
themselves and their upcoming child.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it’s important to recognize that the original
poster is not responsible for their mother’s choices or circumstances. The
argument that they have a moral obligation to support their parent overlooks the
reality of the situation; enabling their mother's addiction by providing
financial support can lead to more harm than good. The poster is prioritizing
their own mental health and stability, which is crucial as they prepare for
parenthood.   A new concise argument for the author not being at fault is that
they are taking proactive steps to establish a healthy environment for their
future child. By refusing to financially support their mother’s addiction, the
original poster is prioritizing the well-being of their own family and setting a
precedent for personal accountability. This decision reflects a commitment to
breaking the cycle of dysfunction rather than perpetuating it.

The original poster is at fault because their refusal to contribute to household
expenses, despite living with their mother, creates unnecessary tension and
neglects the complexities of family dynamics. While it’s understandable to be
wary of enabling an addiction, completely withholding support can leave their
mother feeling abandoned and may worsen her situation. Rather than taking a
hardline stance, the original poster could have engaged in a constructive
dialogue about boundaries and responsibilities, fostering a more supportive
environment.  Additionally, their decision to cut off all financial assistance
ignores the potential for a balanced approach. They could establish clear
conditions for any support, such as attending counseling or seeking help for her
addiction, rather than offering no help at all. This would not only demonstrate
care for their mother’s well-being but also set a positive example for their
future child about the importance of supporting loved ones through difficult
times, even when boundaries are necessary.

Refuting the last YTA argument, it's crucial to understand that the original
poster's decision to not financially support their mother is not an act of
abandonment but rather a necessary measure to protect both their mental health
and their future child's well-being. Enabling their mother's addiction by
providing money could further entrench unhealthy behaviors, which could
ultimately lead to more harm for everyone involved.   A new concise argument for
the author not being at fault is that they are prioritizing their own stability
and that of their future child. By refusing to contribute financially, the
original poster is making a difficult but responsible choice to avoid
perpetuating a cycle of dysfunction. This decision reflects a commitment to
creating a healthier environment for their family, which is essential as they
prepare for parenthood. It's important to recognize that setting boundaries in
this situation is a form of self-care and responsible parenting, not a failure
to support.

cycle of enabling their mother’s addiction. While some may argue that they have
a moral obligation to help, the reality is that providing money could perpetuate
harmful behaviors rather than foster recovery. The poster is prioritizing their
mental health and the well-being of their future child, which is a responsible
stance given the circumstances.  A new concise argument for the author not being

commitment to ensuring that their child grows up in a nurturing and stable
atmosphere, free from the negative influences of addiction. Prioritizing this
future is not just self-serving; it's a crucial aspect of responsible parenting.

of addressing addiction head-on, establishing a foundation for a healthier
family dynamic in the future.

Moderator Summary: **Summary of Arguments:**  **YTA (You're the A**hole)
Argument:** 1. The original poster's refusal to contribute to household expenses
creates unnecessary tension and neglects family dynamics. 2. Withholding support
may leave the mother feeling abandoned, which could worsen her situation. 3. The
poster could have engaged in constructive dialogue about boundaries instead of
taking a hardline stance. 4. Establishing conditions for support (like attending
counseling) could demonstrate care for the mother's well-being and set a
positive example for the future child.  **NTA (Not the A**hole) Argument:** 1.
The original poster is prioritizing their own mental health and the well-being
of their future child by refusing to enable the mother’s addiction. 2. Financial
support could perpetuate harmful behaviors rather than foster recovery. 3. The
decision reflects a commitment to break the cycle of dysfunction and ensure a
stable environment for their child. 4. They are setting an important precedent
for accountability and responsible decision-making.  **Conclusion:** The debate
hinges on the tension between enabling a parent's addiction versus taking
responsible steps to protect oneself and one's future family. The NTA argument
effectively emphasizes the necessity of prioritizing mental health and the well-
being of the future child, which is crucial in parenting. While the YTA argument
raises valid points about family dynamics and emotional support, it does not
address the potential harm caused by enabling addiction. Therefore, the NTA
perspective is ultimately more compelling in this context as it prioritizes the
health and stability of the future child.  **Winner: NTA**

- Prioritize your mental health and the well-being of your future child by
refraining from providing financial support that could enable your mother's
addiction. - Consider establishing boundaries that protect you and your child,
clearly communicating these limits to your mother without alienating her
completely. - Engage in open dialogue about your concerns regarding her
addiction, possibly suggesting that she seeks professional help or counseling as
a condition for your support. - Acknowledge the importance of breaking the cycle
of dysfunction, and recognize that your decision reflects a commitment to
creating a stable environment for your upcoming family. - Keep in mind that
fostering accountability and responsible decision-making in your own life sets a
positive example for both your mother and your future child. - Remain firm in
your stance while also expressing concern and care, reminding your mother that
your refusal to support her financially is rooted in a desire for her to seek
recovery and improvement in her life.
