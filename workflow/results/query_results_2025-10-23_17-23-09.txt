=== QUERY ===
I am (20M) an international Actuarial Science student currently in my third year of study 
of a 7 year  program. Recently I received a call from my father telling me that he wants 
my 33 year old brother to join me at school doing the program I am doing as a First year 
and asking if it was possible for him to apply with his degree and results and if I could 
help with that.   Some backstory on my brother is that he did go to school for Business 
Management in my native country but has been struggling to get a job. He wanted to do a 
masters but that didn't go through, (don't what to bash my brother here but even with this 
degree he was on and off and would decide when he would go to school or not, this caused him 
to spend nearly twice as long the duration). After he finished he couldn't find a job and 
somewhere along the line he gave up I guess.   He has been home doing nothing for like 7 
years now. He was being encouraged by my other relatives to find a job, maybe in a different 
field or least do something in the meantime. Multiple programmes, courses etc popped up during 
those years but he rejected them saying he wants to do something else.   Back to me now, 
So after my first year abroad I noticed how my bills and tuition fees where putting a strain 
on my parents when I would go back on holiday, this continued until one day I overheard them 
saying they had taken a collateral loan on their car in order to make the deadline for my 
tuitions. I asked what was going on and they tried to downplay saying that they would always 
do this when they paid my fees and they had nearly payed back the chain loans. It was always 
a stressful when due dates would I arrive and I had to call them over and over asking for money.   
I felt bad for them and decided I needed to find a cheaper school as this situation was untenable. 
I spent close to year looking for a cheaper school in the same country till I found it. So I 
ended transferring from that better school to this one so that at least my parents can breathe 
and save up for their pension as they quite older. The situation became better but far from 
ideal, the major stress comes from things like rent and groceries as money is still scarce.   
Now fast forward to today, NOW TELL ME WHY DO THEY SUDDENLY THINK THAT THEY CAN NOW DOUBLE THE 
AMOUNT THEY CAN SPEND BY SENDING MY BROTHER HERE. I thought I had done the right thing by proactively 
seeking cheaper schools and accommodation so that things are no longer so tight and stressful 
to the wire. Now if they go through with this idea it will be worse than before and I don't 
know if I can handle it.   I know I sound so heartless and selfish to my own blood but, I know 
if they go through with this my living standards will drastically worsen. I already receive no 
pocket money or anything like that, the only cash I have is from the small saving I have from transport 
costs when I decide to walk or wait for the evening buses

Title: AITA for not giving my benefits to our households joint account

So our household consists of my dad my brother and me. So I first of all my mom
passed away 5 years ago. I am now 21 and my brother is 23 years old.   My dad is
known for us as someone you can’t discuss with in any way. For example one time
I came home from the train station with my bike. I opened the garage put my bike
away and close the garage door. When I came inside my dad suddenly asked angry
why I closed the garage door. I said it was closed so I closed it again like any
normal person would do. Then he said no it was open and he started shouting.
Like why would you should for something small like that. Just open the garage
door again if it bothers you that much. (The door was 100% certainly closed.)
Around 5 years ago nearly 2 weeks after my mom passed we also saw that he was
paying for fictional p*rn chat sites. This disgusted us and we are now talking
in amounts of € 10.000 so it’s not that it was like € 5 per month.   So about
the main subject. We have a joint account where we each put on € 700 each month.
This is for our monthly expenses like electricity, heating, water, etc. We also
use this for things like clothes that everyone needs.   Now my employer gives me
a few benefits like 30% discount on my electricity bill. I also have the
opportunity to work from home and get a few benefits with that as well. I get €
75 per month for my internet paid directly to my ISP so everyone benefits from
this in our household, I get € 50 per month just for working from home.   Now my
dad wants me to deposit the 30% discount I get paid for the electricity
discount. Honestly I don’t want to because I think € 700 per month is already a
lot to pay as rent to your parents to stay home. Now I live in Belgium where the
rent is not to bad but you still high and with your monthly expenses I would be
a tiny bit worse off living on my own. For the people saying yeah but that’s
with your food and everything. Yeah you are all right but I can live a lot
cheaper than my dad and my brother.   For that and because the benefit is for me
because I work in the electricity sector, I don’t want to deposit this on the
joint account.   I am really hard on saving and investing my money for this
reason I can really save every € I can. So do you guys think I am the AH?
Edit: so I see some people asking how the discount works. Well the discount will
go on my pay check because they are not the same company as my energy bill
company. The Belgian ISP’s have a system where they can use third party payment
provider. The energy billing companies don’t have this I think.   Maybe an
important thing as well: my brother is not an AH. We have our differences but as
a whole he is not a bad person like my dad is.  Some people may think that I
just want to talk bad about my dad but everything that I said in here I said for
a reason. I’ve been on an Erasmus exchange program in Finland and lived 4 months
away from him in peace so I’ve had the chance to think about my situation
clearly.   Also some people telling me I should maybe move out and I thought of
this many times but I am still 20 y/o and don’t really want to because I live in
a strategically good place for work and friends and the area is expensive.   I
have also talked to him about this a few moments ago and he agreed that I keep
it. The € 75 per month is plenty for my homework expenses.

I am a 30F and my parents have been living with me for the past 5 years (I pay
for rent, utilities and most expenses). It is completely out their choice, I
don't need them to live with me. I have an elder brother who is married, both of
them work. He earns as much as me and SIL earns a bit lesser. But since parents
don't live with him, he's not asked to pitch in for any recurring expenses. I
don't think he would say no but he's not come forward to pitch in either. Though
I don't think he particularly wants to live full time with them. Everytime I
have broached the topic, he's dodged it.  My relationship with my father is
fraught. While I love him, he still likes to extend control over my life and
treat my finances as his.  He's manipulative and everytime I ask him to pick up
a few of their bills, he goes "Oh so you mean you want all of us to go separate
ways" etc.   While he has significant savings, he refuses to get a debit card or
credit card or adopt any app that would enable him to make digital payments -
sort of a forced financial dependence. He knows how to use all these financial
devices and had a good career in the government before retiring. Instead he asks
me to make all the payments. If I push back a little bit, he makes a show of
"giving me money because I asked for it" and guilt tripping me.   I am tired of
being manipulated, micromanaged and treated as a child even though I'm the one
taking care of everything. I've given up a lot of my social life over the past 5
years because they're quite controlling/need me/manipulative. This is not just
financial but in daily life as well. I want to move out and reduce expenses and
increase my savings which would make them move in with my brother that too after
much guilt tripping bs and me appearing as a the bitch in the family.   WIBTA
for doing so?

Title: AITA for "throwing a fit" after my mom got mad at me?

Posting this before I go to bed maybe regret it tomorrow morning anyway, for
some context: I live in an Asian household and like the stereotypes my mom has
always been a straight-A student and top of her school, my older sibling has
always been praised for being super smart from a young age. Me? I struggle with
school. I wasn't always like this, and my grades aren't bad, they're just not
all As.   I've switched to online classes and so my mom said that I shouldn't
have bad grades or missing work etc. I've been doing good so far, I've had some
missing assignments here and there but end up turning them in late (but no late
penalty) and my assignments are always in the range of 85%-100% but for some
classes even with those percentages the total grade is like a D or C (It's a
whole thing) I told my mom about it when she asked about my grades, she agreed
it was strange.  One night after I when out with my friends she yelled at me for
not turning in all of my assignments and etc same conversation from before. She
kept switching what she was mad about every time I tried to explain myself. She
told me no going out unless I turn in all of my assignments. I did all of my
work and then I thought that was the end of it.  Since then, she would
constantly ask about my grades. It gets on my nerves. She's been asking about
literally nothing but school work, so obviously whenever she mentions school
again I get a little agitated, but I don't want to get in trouble I don't say
anything. When I get agitated I close my door a little too hard, or I walk a
little too loud, and etc. So she would say "why are you so mad?" and "I guess I
won't tell you to do anything" (Not exact words but I can't exactly translate
it)  Today was when things sort of "blew up". Not sure how it even started but
basically, my family (mom, dad, sibling) sat me down and said I need a better
schedule/routine and etc. They told me things as if I could follow routines best
fit for them, and maybe I could but it wouldn't be best for *me*. Later my mom
and dad were talking and asked me why I was "throwing a fit" (not sure what they
word they used is in English but that's close to it) and I said that I'm allowed
to have emotions. Later my mom came into my room and asked why I'm mad at her,
then I blew up. I told her, while sobbing, that I'm tired of her always talking
about school and that I'm really trying my hardest, and that I can't take it
whenever she talks about school. I told her that she hasn't talked to me about
anything but school. She completely missed the point, she kept telling me that
she has to so that my grades would be better. I honestly don't know what she was
talking about because I was so shocked at her response. She ended the
conversation with "I'm too scared to even talk to you" (another rough
translation). Me and mom are super close, the post may not seem like it but it's
true, I love her more than anyone. That's why I don't know what to do, so am I
the asshole?

Title: AITAH :-for telling my half-sisters that the difference between us is very clear?

I'm from a country that doesn't speak English, and all... I'm writing from a
different account, the names are in yours because my family has Reddit.  i'm
Eleni, ( 25F) My story began when I was young.  I grew up in a large family, and
when I say large, I mean literally large. My mom, dad, three half-sisters from
my dad's deceased wife (Sophia, Tia, and Monica), me, my two younger sisters
(Noah and Nia, the twins), my unmarried aunt, my two grandmothers, and my
paternal grandfather. My large family of 12 members. None of them worked except
my dad, mom, and aunt. Our financial situation is rubbish. I always felt that
our financial situation would have been great if my dad had stopped spending so
much money on his daughters from his first wife.  And when I say a lot of money,
it really is. He buys them expensive things.  :- Clothing and Makeup I remember
one time he bought Mony a dress for $250, while he refused to give me taxi
money. Gifts for no reason.  When I complained to my grandfather about my
father, he told me that my sisters didn't have a mother to care for them and
that my father wanted to make up for it.  And that when my sisters grew up, they
would work and the situation would end.  But that didn't happen because all
three of them entered private universities near our house. My father wanted to
buy them cars, and of course, our situation got much worse.  Noah and Nia only
had two jackets for the winter, which they changed into as spare parts. As time
went on, my sisters didn't work.  When I was 17, my father came to prepare me so
I could start working at 18, pay rent, and contribute to the household expenses.
The strange thing is that my entire family agreed. I asked my father why his
daughters didn't work. He told me I shouldn't compare myself to someone who
doesn't have a mother. I told him that  My mother treated them like her own
children; she probably pampered them more than we did.  Of course, I worked in a
restaurant and at a bookstore. Noah and Nia grew up and went to different
universities. Years passed, and I graduated, worked, and helped Noah and Nia.
Two weeks ago, I was at work. Nia called and said she was under my new house and
needed someone to open the door for her. I went home, let her in, and we sat
down. Suddenly, she told me that her father had kicked her out of the house
because she refused to work. (For your information, Nia's field of study is
difficult and requires focus, and it's hard for her to work while studying.)
Mouni called and asked me to explain her mistake to Nia and let her work and pay
her father's rent. I cursed Mouni and told her that she was selfish like her
father and that she and her siblings were spoiled in our father's house. Of
course, I was met with her famous crying spell.  Everyone called, even Sophie
the Charismatic called and asked me how I could upset her sister.  And she
thought there was no difference between us.  I told her that the difference
between us was very clear

Title: AITA for continuing to use my 529?
Score: 13
Post ID: 1oclls7

VERY long story short...I am in undergrad right now and left home a few months
ago after a particularly bad fight with my mother. For context, I only live
there during the summers when I'm home from school. Her and I have always gotten
along, but she has always been very volatile and has been abusive at times and
that has caused strain on the relationship. This summer was a bit of a breaking
point, and I left home before I was supposed to because she got so angry she
insisted she didn't want to live with me anymore. I have since stopped most
contact with her and she is very upset. This past weekend, she demanded I give
her back the my 529 (for those who don't know, this is a special savings account
you can use to pay for educational expenses). My dilemma is that I am completely
on my own financially and literally cannot live without this money...I live off
campus and cannot afford food or tuition or rent without the 529. She insists I
should take out loans like she did and that I am acting entitled for refusing to
give her the money back. What do you all think?
