=== QUERY ===
My boyfriend and I went to get pedicures together, something we rarely do and I thought would be a nice, 
    low-key couples activity. He finished before me, and I still had about 25–30 minutes left. Instead of waiting and 
    relaxing, he suddenly said it felt too hot inside and announced that he was going to walk home to "get some exercise," 
    since his doctor told him to move more. For context, it wasn't hot outside at all, it was around 70° and really pleasant. 
    He kept asking if I was okay with him leaving, which made it feel even stranger, like he was waiting for permission to 
    do something he already knew I'd find odd. I told him it was his choice, but I didn't really understand why he couldn't 
    just wait. He ended up walking home, which took about 23 minutes. The whole thing felt off, though, mostly because that 
    just so happened to line up exactly with the time his Discord group (which includes one particular female friend he always 
    seems eager to talk to) usually gets online. I just found it inconsiderate. We went together, it was supposed to be 
    something shared, and he couldn't stay 25 more minutes until I was done?

hi, my friend asked me to drive her to her nail appointment since she will be late for it. I said no to her because 
i have other things to do later and i didn't want to leave home another time just for this. Usually i drive every 
single friend of mine everytime we hang out since im the only one with a car, ( im 18 i just got my license ) and 
im kinda tired of being people's uber.    This friend got angry at me and said that i should act like a friend and 
help her. I think that she should get her appointments only if she is able to actually get there in time and their 
things should not depend on me....

Title: AITA for expecting my boyfriend to lock the door (and get the keys after forgetting)?

My boyfriend and I are university students living in separate shared flats. We frequently alternate where we 
sleep. I have an independent key for his flat, but my apartment only has two keys, meaning I can't give him one.
  I usually leave for the gym at 6:40 AM. My shift-working flatmate is already gone, so I am responsible for 
  locking up. My boyfriend, a night owl, was asleep when I got up. I forgot I couldn't lock the door with him 
  inside. I woke him, asked him to lock the door after me, and return the keys later at university - something 
  we've done before. I placed the keys right by his phone.  Later, when I asked for the keys, he was completely
   unaware, having forgotten our exchange while half-asleep. This resulted in two problems:  1. The apartment 
   door was didn’t have the deadbolt in. (which I view as unsafe). 2. I was locked out. My flatmate was only 
   briefly home in the afternoon before leaving again for the night, forcing me to either wait until late for 
   his return or interrupt...

My (F39) BF (M43) gets up at 5:30am for work. I get up at 7am for work. He usually turns on the light and 
goes about getting ready between the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen. I usually don’t mind him going in and out 
a couple times.   This morning he turns on the light, goes in and makes a cup of coffee and then comes back 
in and asks me to move to the other side of the bed so he can relax in bed and have his coffee. In a daze 
I did. About 2 mins later I’m pissed. He’s got the light on, scrolling on his phone, drinking his coffee, 
and tapping his foot (like an ankle shaking type nervous thing?). I get up and he asks where I’m going, I 
say well either home to sleep the rest of my 1.5 hours or to make some coffee I guess.   He in turn goes on 
about how my bad attitude has ruined his day for work.   As far as I know, usually when one person gets up 
before the other, they may turn on the light for a minute and get dressed or get their clothes for the day 
and turn the light back off and go into...

My partnergot a hair cut over the weekend and we didn't see each other until Monday. When we finally met up 
and I was able to see his haircut I didn't love it because I personally prefer longer hair on him, but, obviously 
I didn't mention anything about not loving it. (He definitely knows that I like longer hair on him and he has 
accepted my opinion without any sort of trouble or fighting). A couple minutes later he asked me what I thought 
about his haircut. He can get very sensitive about his haircuts, so I made sure that I was able to give him my 
honest opinion without saying anything that could be misconstrued of taken the wrong way.  Finally I ended up 
telling him: "It's not my favorite haircut but I think it looks good!". At first he didn't take this the wrong 
way, we kept talking like we normally would. A couple of hours went by and he got extremely upset with me. He 
said that even if he asked me what my opinion was I shouldn't have told him that. He said that the only thing I go...

I want to start by saying this isn't a serious argument between me (32F) and my boyfriend (33M). It's something 
we were laughing about, but something he also genuinely believes, and he pushed me to make the post because he 
thinks he's right and that people will agree with him. Lol.   Right now, I'm wearing what you could say are 
"booty shorts" and a t-shirt. My dad's friend is over to do some work on my house. My boyfriend asks why I am 
wearing shorts and not pants, that we're clearly different people because he would wear pants if he had guests 
over. I said, what I'm wearing is normal, this is normal. He disagrees. So, AITA for not wearing pants when other 
people visit?...
